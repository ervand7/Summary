### 1️⃣ Synchronous (request → response)

Example:
User opens a website → clicks “Pay”

```
Browser → API Gateway → Lambda → response
```

* User waits for the result
* Lambda returns success / error immediately
* If Lambda fails → caller sees the error

👉 Like a normal HTTP request.

### 2️⃣ Asynchronous (fire and forget)

Example:
User uploads a photo → create thumbnails

```
S3 upload → Lambda (later)
```

* User does NOT wait
* AWS queues the event
* AWS retries automatically if Lambda fails

👉 Like sending an email: you don’t wait for the recipient to read it.
