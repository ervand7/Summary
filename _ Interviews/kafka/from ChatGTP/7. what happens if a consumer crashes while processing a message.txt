👉 The message will be reprocessed by another consumer if the offset was not committed.

What happens step by step:
* Consumer reads a message
* If it crashes before committing the offset:

  * Kafka triggers a rebalance
  * Another consumer in the same group takes over the partition
  * Processing resumes from the last committed offset
  * 👉 the message is read again (at-least-once delivery)

If the offset WAS committed before the crash:
* Kafka considers the message successfully processed
* The message is not reprocessed
* Potential risk: message loss (if commit happened too early)

Interview takeaway:
> Kafka provides at-least-once delivery by default; if a consumer crashes before
committing offsets, another consumer will reprocess the message.
