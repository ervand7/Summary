Unit tests:
* Test small pieces (functions/classes)
* Fast, isolated
* No external dependencies

Integration tests:
* Test components working together
* Use real DBs/services (or close mocks)
* Slower than unit tests

End-to-end (E2E) tests:
* Test full system flow
* Closest to real user behavior
* Slowest and most expensive

Rule of thumb:
> Many unit tests, fewer integration tests, minimal E2E
