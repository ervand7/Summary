A sequential scan means PostgreSQL reads the entire table from start to end.

When it’s preferred:

* Small tables
* Large percentage of rows needed
* No useful index
* Sequential I/O is cheaper than random I/O

Key idea:

> Using an index is not always faster.

One-liner (interview-ready):

> PostgreSQL uses a sequential scan when reading most of a table is cheaper than using
an index.
