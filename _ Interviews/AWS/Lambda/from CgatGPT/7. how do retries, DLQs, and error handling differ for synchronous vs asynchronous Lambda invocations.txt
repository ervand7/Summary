Lambda error handling depends on invocation type.

Synchronous invocation (e.g. API Gateway, ALB):

* Caller waits for response
* No automatic retries by Lambda
* Errors returned directly to caller (4xx / 5xx)
* DLQ is NOT supported
* Retries must be implemented by the caller or client

Error handling strategy:
* Validate input early
* Return explicit errors
* Handle idempotency on client-triggered retries

Asynchronous invocation (e.g. EventBridge, SNS):

* Lambda invoked in background
* Lambda automatically retries on failure
  - Default: 2 retries
* Retries are managed by AWS, not the caller
* Supports DLQ (SQS or SNS)
* Failed events after retries go to DLQ

Error handling strategy:
* Assume at-least-once delivery
* Make function idempotent
* Monitor DLQ and replay messages

Key differences summary:

* Sync → no retries, no DLQ, immediate error to caller
* Async → automatic retries, DLQ supported, eventual failure handling

Interview answer to “How do retries and DLQs work in Lambda?”

> Synchronous invocations return errors directly and don’t support DLQs or automatic retries.
Asynchronous invocations retry automatically and can send failed events to a DLQ after retries,
so the function must be idempotent and monitored.

👉 Think: `sync = caller handles errors`, `async = Lambda retries + DLQ`.
