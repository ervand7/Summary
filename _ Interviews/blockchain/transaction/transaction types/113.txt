Transaction type **113** (hex `0x71`) in **zkSync Era** enables **Account Abstraction**,
allowing users to operate smart contract accounts with custom validation logic instead of
standard externally owned accounts (EOAs).

**Key Highlights:**

- **Account Abstraction Support:** Users implement the `IAccount` interface in their account
contracts, defining custom validation (e.g., signature checks) and execution logic.

- **Bootloader Interaction:** The zkSync bootloader system contract (`msg.sender`) manages the
transaction lifecycle, calling `validateTransaction` and `executeTransaction` on the user's
account contract.

- **Transaction Lifecycle:**
  - **Validation Phase:**
    1. Checks nonce uniqueness using `NonceHolder`.
    2. Calls `validateTransaction` to verify the signature and increment the nonce.
    3. Ensures the account has enough balance for fees.
    4. Processes fee payment via `payForTransaction`.
  - **Execution Phase:**
    - Executes the transaction logic in `executeTransaction`.

- **System Contracts and Libraries:** Utilizes zkSync's system contracts and libraries like
`SystemContractsCaller` for interacting with protocol-level features.

**Summary:**

Type 113 transactions in zkSync allow for customizable smart contract accounts, enhancing
flexibility and security by integrating Account Abstraction directly into the protocol.
