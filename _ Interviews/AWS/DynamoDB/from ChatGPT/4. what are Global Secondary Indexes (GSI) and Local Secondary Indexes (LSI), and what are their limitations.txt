Global Secondary Index (GSI) lets you query DynamoDB using an alternative
partition key and sort key, effectively querying across all table partitions.

Key limitations:

* GSIs are always eventually consistent (no strongly consistent reads)
* They have separate read/write capacity
* They are updated asynchronously from the base table


Local Secondary Index (LSI) lets you query DynamoDB using an alternative
sort key while keeping the same partition key as the base table.

Key properties / limitations:

* Same partition key as the base table
* Different sort key
* Supports strongly consistent reads
* Must be defined at table creation time
* Shares table read/write capacity
