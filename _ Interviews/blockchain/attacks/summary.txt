### 1. **Reentrancy Attacks**

**Description:**
A reentrancy attack occurs when a malicious contract repeatedly calls a vulnerable contract
before the initial execution is completed. This can manipulate the contract's state in
unintended ways. The infamous DAO attack exploited this vulnerability, leading to significant
financial loss.

**Example:**
A contract that sends Ether to an external address before updating its balance can be
exploited. The attacker can recursively call the withdraw function to drain funds.

**Mitigation:**
- **Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern:** Update the contract’s state before making
external calls.
- **Reentrancy Guards:** Use mutexes or the `ReentrancyGuard` modifier from OpenZeppelin to
prevent multiple simultaneous calls.

---

### 2. **Integer Overflow and Underflow**

**Description:**
Before Solidity version 0.8.0, arithmetic operations did not automatically check for
overflows or underflows, allowing attackers to exploit these behaviors to manipulate
numerical values in contracts.

**Example:**
If a contract subtracts 1 from a variable that is already 0, it could wrap around to a very
large number, leading to unexpected behavior.

**Mitigation:**
- **Use Solidity ≥0.8.0:** These versions include built-in overflow and underflow checks.
- **SafeMath Libraries:** Utilize libraries like OpenZeppelin’s SafeMath for arithmetic
operations, which include safety checks.

---

### 3. **Front-Running and Miner Extractable Value (MEV)**

**Description:**
Front-running involves an attacker observing pending transactions and submitting their own
transactions with higher gas fees to get prioritized by miners. MEV refers to the maximum
value miners can extract by reordering, including, or excluding transactions within a block.

**Example:**
An attacker sees a pending transaction to buy a token and quickly submits a buy order with a
higher gas fee to purchase before the original transaction, potentially manipulating the
token’s price.

**Mitigation:**
- **Commit-Reveal Schemes:** Conceal critical information until all commitments are made.
- **Batch Auctions:** Aggregate transactions to minimize individual transaction influence.
- **Use of Private Transactions:** Platforms like Flashbots can help reduce MEV by enabling
private transaction submission.

---

### 4. **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks**

**Description:**
DoS attacks aim to make a smart contract or the entire network unavailable or unusable by
overwhelming it with requests or exploiting vulnerabilities that cause the contract to fail.

**Types of DoS Attacks:**
- **DoS with Revert:** An attacker causes critical functions to revert, blocking legitimate
users.
- **DoS with Block Gas Limit:** Making certain operations excessively gas-consuming to prevent
them from executing.

**Mitigation:**
- **Fail-Safe Coding Practices:** Ensure that critical functions are not dependent on external
calls that can fail.
- **Gas Optimization:** Write efficient code to prevent hitting gas limits.
- **Circuit Breakers:** Implement emergency stop mechanisms to halt operations in case of
detected attacks.

---

### 5. **Access Control Vulnerabilities**

**Description:**
Improper implementation of access controls can allow unauthorized users to perform privileged
actions, such as transferring ownership or executing administrative functions.

**Example:**
A contract function intended only for the owner is not properly restricted, allowing anyone
to call it and change the contract’s owner.

**Mitigation:**
- **Use Access Control Libraries:** Leverage well-audited libraries like OpenZeppelin’s
AccessControl.
- **Role-Based Permissions:** Define clear roles and permissions for different functionalities.
- **Modifiers:** Implement Solidity modifiers to enforce access restrictions on sensitive
functions.

---

### 6. **Unprotected `selfdestruct` Function**

**Description:**
If a contract’s `selfdestruct` function is not properly restricted, an attacker can
permanently remove the contract from the blockchain, disrupting the dApp’s functionality.

**Mitigation:**
- **Restrict Access:** Ensure that only authorized addresses can invoke `selfdestruct`.
- **Avoid Unnecessary Use:** Refrain from including `selfdestruct` in contracts unless
absolutely necessary.

---

### 7. **Unchecked External Calls**

**Description:**
Failing to handle the return values or errors from external calls can lead to unexpected
behaviors, including loss of funds or inconsistent state.

**Example:**
Using low-level calls like `call` without checking if the operation succeeded can allow
the contract to proceed under false assumptions.

**Mitigation:**
- **Check Return Values:** Always verify the success of external calls.
- **Use High-Level Calls:** Prefer Solidity’s high-level function calls which automatically
handle errors.

---

### 8. **Delegatecall and Proxy Contract Vulnerabilities**

**Description:**
Using `delegatecall` improperly can allow an attacker to manipulate the storage of the calling
contract, potentially leading to a complete takeover.

**Example:**
A malicious implementation contract can modify the storage variables of the proxy contract to
change ownership or redirect funds.

**Mitigation:**
- **Careful Storage Management:** Ensure that the storage layout between proxy and
implementation contracts is consistent.
- **Limit Functionality:** Restrict the functions that can be called via `delegatecall`.
- **Use Trusted Libraries:** Utilize well-audited proxy patterns and libraries like
OpenZeppelin’s Upgradeable Contracts.

---

### 9. **Time Dependency Attacks**

**Description:**
Relying on block timestamps or block numbers for critical functionality can be exploited,
as miners have some influence over these values.

**Example:**
A contract that releases funds based on block timestamps can be manipulated by miners to
release funds earlier or later than intended.

**Mitigation:**
- **Avoid Critical Dependencies:** Do not use block timestamps for crucial logic.
- **Use Multiple Sources:** Combine multiple factors or use external oracles for time-sensitive
data.

---

### 10. **Randomness Manipulation**

**Description:**
Generating pseudo-random numbers on-chain is inherently insecure, as they can be predicted or
influenced by miners, leading to manipulation in games, lotteries, or other applications
relying on randomness.

**Example:**
A contract that uses `blockhash` and `block.timestamp` to generate random numbers can be
exploited by miners to influence the outcome.

**Mitigation:**
- **Use Oracles:** Integrate with secure randomness providers like Chainlink VRF.
- **Commit-Reveal Schemes:** Implement mechanisms where users commit to a value before
revealing it, reducing predictability.

---

### 11. **Short Address Attack**

**Description:**
An attacker crafts transactions with improperly sized address inputs, causing the contract
to misinterpret the data and potentially altering parameter values.

**Mitigation:**
- **Input Validation:** Ensure that all input data is properly validated and of expected length.
- **Use Solidity’s ABI Encoding:** Leverage Solidity’s built-in mechanisms for handling
function calls and parameter encoding.

---

### 12. **Flash Loan Attacks**

**Description:**
Flash loans allow users to borrow large amounts of funds without collateral, provided the
loan is repaid within the same transaction. Attackers can use flash loans to manipulate
markets or exploit vulnerabilities in contracts within a single transaction.

**Example:**
Using a flash loan to manipulate a price oracle, allowing the attacker to execute profitable
trades based on the manipulated price.

**Mitigation:**
- **Robust Oracle Mechanisms:** Use decentralized and tamper-resistant oracles.
- **Implement Transaction Limits:** Restrict the size and frequency of transactions that
can affect critical parameters.
- **Check State Consistencies:** Ensure that contract states remain consistent before and
after transactions.

---

### 13. **Phishing and Social Engineering**

**Description:**
While not a direct smart contract vulnerability, phishing involves tricking users into
interacting with malicious contracts or revealing sensitive information, leading to loss of
funds or data.

**Mitigation:**
- **User Education:** Educate users about the risks of interacting with unknown contracts.
- **Use Trusted Platforms:** Encourage the use of verified and audited dApps.
- **Implement Safety Checks:** Integrate warning systems that alert users about suspicious
contract interactions.

---

### 14. **Contract Upgrade Vulnerabilities**

**Description:**
Upgradeable contracts allow for updating contract logic without changing the contract address.
However, flaws in the upgrade mechanism can allow attackers to take control of the contract
or introduce malicious code.

**Mitigation:**
- **Use Secure Proxy Patterns:** Follow well-audited patterns like the Transparent or UUPS
proxies from OpenZeppelin.
- **Access Control on Upgrades:** Restrict upgrade functionalities to authorized roles.
- **Thorough Auditing:** Regularly audit upgrade mechanisms to ensure their security.

---

### 15. **Storage Collision**

**Description:**
In proxy contract patterns, if the storage layout between the proxy and implementation
contracts is inconsistent, it can lead to storage collisions, causing unintended overwrites
of important variables.

**Mitigation:**
- **Consistent Storage Layout:** Carefully manage and document storage structures across all
contract versions.
- **Use Inheritance Properly:** Leverage inheritance to maintain storage order and consistency.
- **Automated Tools:** Utilize tools and libraries that enforce storage layout consistency.

---

### 16. **Gas Limit and Block Gas Limit Attacks**

**Description:**
Attackers can manipulate gas consumption to cause transactions to fail or prevent certain
operations by making them exceed the block gas limit.

**Mitigation:**
- **Optimize Gas Usage:** Write efficient smart contract code to minimize gas consumption.
- **Limit Loop Iterations:** Avoid unbounded loops or operations that can consume excessive gas.
- **Use Pull Over Push Patterns:** Instead of pushing funds, allow users to withdraw,
reducing the risk of hitting gas limits during mass withdrawals.

---

### 17. **Signature Malleability**

**Description:**
Signature malleability allows altering a signature without invalidating it, potentially
enabling replay attacks or manipulation of signature-based functions.

**Mitigation:**
- **Use EIP-712:** Implement structured data hashing and signing to prevent signature
malleability.
- **Validate Signatures Properly:** Ensure that signatures are checked against the expected
signer and data.

### 18. **Second preimage attack** — это криптографическая атака, при которой злоумышленник
пытается найти другое сообщение, которое даст ту же хеш-значение, что и у исходного сообщения.
Важно отметить, что цель атаки — найти **второе сообщение** с тем же хешем, а не восстановить
исходное сообщение.

### Пример:
Если у нас есть сообщение **M**, и его хеш **H(M)**, то задача злоумышленника — найти **M'**,
такое что **H(M') = H(M)**, где **M ≠ M'**.

### Применение в блокчейне:
Для блокчейнов и криптографии в целом, хеш-функции (например, SHA-256) должны быть устойчивы
к таким атакам, чтобы злоумышленники не могли создавать фальшивые данные с тем же хешем,
что и у оригинальных данных (например, блоков или транзакций).

### Защита:
Для современных хеш-функций атака на поиск второго прообраза является вычислительно сложной и
непрактичной.
