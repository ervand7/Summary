In SQL, the `CONCURRENTLY` option in a `CREATE INDEX` statement is used to
create an index on a table concurrently, without blocking write operations
on the table during the index creation process. This is particularly useful
for large tables in production databases where you want to avoid locking the
table for write operations while the index is being built.

When you create an index using the `CONCURRENTLY` option, the database system
employs various techniques to build the index without causing substantial locks
on the table. It often involves creating a separate temporary index and then
swapping it with the original index once it's ready. The details of how this
is achieved can vary between different database management systems.

Here's an example of how to use `CONCURRENTLY` in a `CREATE INDEX` statement:

```sql
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_example_column
ON example_table (column_name);
```

Where:
- `CONCURRENTLY` specifies that the index should be created concurrently.
- `idx_example_column` is the name of the index you're creating.
- `example_table` is the name of the table for which you're creating the index.
- `column_name` is the name of the column for which you're creating an index.

Please note that not all database management systems support concurrent index
creation, and the specific behavior might vary between systems. PostgreSQL,
for example, is known for its support of concurrent indexing through the
`CONCURRENTLY` option. Other systems might have similar but differently named
options or different methods for handling concurrent index creation.

Using `CONCURRENTLY` can help maintain database availability and reduce the
potential impact on applications that rely on the indexed table. However,
it's important to be aware of the potential performance implications of
concurrent indexing, as it might require more system resources.
