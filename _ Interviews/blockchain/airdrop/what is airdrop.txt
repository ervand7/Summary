In the context of blockchain, an **airdrop** refers to the distribution of
cryptocurrency tokens or assets directly to the wallets of users, usually for
free. This process is typically used as a marketing strategy by blockchain projects
to raise awareness, attract new users, or reward loyal participants. Airdrops can
happen for various reasons, including:

1. **Promotion**: To promote a new cryptocurrency or project by giving away
tokens to potential users.
2. **Loyalty rewards**: To reward early adopters or users who have been
actively supporting the project.
3. **Forks**: When a blockchain undergoes a fork, new tokens from the forked
chain may be airdropped to holders of the original cryptocurrency.
4. **Token distribution**: In decentralized finance (DeFi) or governance
projects, airdrops may be used to distribute tokens for voting rights or governance
participation.

Users typically qualify for airdrops based on criteria like holding a specific
cryptocurrency, performing certain actions (like signing up or following social media
channels), or being part of a particular blockchain network.
