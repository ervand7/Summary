Proxy and Adapter solve different design problems.

Proxy provides a substitute for an object to control access or add behavior (e.g.,
access checks, lazy initialization, caching, logging) while keeping the same
interface as the real object.

Adapter converts the interface of one class into another interface expected by
the client, allowing incompatible classes to work together without modifying their code.

In short:
Proxy = same interface, extra control or optimization
Adapter = different interface, compatibility bridge
