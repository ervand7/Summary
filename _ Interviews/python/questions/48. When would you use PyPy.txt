Use PyPy when:
* Workload is CPU-bound
* Code has long-running loops
* Uses pure Python (few C extensions)

Why:
* JIT compilation speeds up execution
* Often faster than CPython for compute-heavy code

Avoid when:
* Heavy C-extension usage
* Strict CPython compatibility required

Rule of thumb:
> PyPy for long-running, pure-Python workloads
