Cache memory sizes can vary widely depending on the specific architecture and purpose of the cache. Here are common cache memory sizes:

1. **L1 Cache**: This is the smallest and fastest cache, typically built directly
into the CPU core. It often includes separate caches for instructions (L1i) and
data (L1d). Sizes can range from 16KB to 128KB per core.

2. **L2 Cache**: This cache is typically shared among CPU cores in a single CPU
core complex (CCX) or socket. Sizes can range from 128KB to 1MB or more per core,
depending on the architecture.

3. **L3 Cache**: This is a shared cache that spans multiple CPU cores. It's
usually found in multi-core processors to facilitate communication between
cores. Sizes can vary widely, from a few megabytes to tens of megabytes or more.

4. **Smart Cache**: Some modern processors have a unified or "smart" cache,
which combines L2 and L3 caches into a single, more efficient cache structure.

5. **Last-Level Cache (LLC)**: In some server-grade processors, especially
those with many cores, there might be an additional layer of cache known as
the LLC, which can range from tens of megabytes to over 100MB.

6. **GPU Cache**: Graphics processing units (GPUs) also have their own caches.
Sizes can vary significantly, with high-end GPUs having several megabytes of
cache memory.

7. **Storage Caches**: In storage devices like SSDs and HDDs, there are often
small caches (from a few megabytes to a few gigabytes) used to speed up read
and write operations.

8. **Web Browser Caches**: Browsers use caches to store web page data, which
can be configured by the user but is typically limited to a few hundred megabytes.

Remember that these sizes are approximate and can vary depending on the specific
processor or device. Cache sizes can significantly impact the performance of a
system, as they play a crucial role in reducing memory latency and improving
data access times.
