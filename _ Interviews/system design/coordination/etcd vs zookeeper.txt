| Aspect                 | etcd                       | ZooKeeper                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Primary use            | Config & service discovery | Coordination & leader election |
| API                    | gRPC / HTTP                | Custom TCP protocol            |
| Data model             | Key–value                  | Hierarchical (znodes)          |
| Consistency            | Strong (Raft)              | Strong (ZAB)                   |
| Watch mechanism        | Native, simple             | Native, more complex           |
| Operational complexity | Simple                     | Harder to operate              |
| Typical ecosystem      | Kubernetes (native)        | Hadoop, Kafka (legacy)         |
| Client simplicity      | Easy                       | More complex                   |
| Current trend          | Modern default             | Legacy / declining         |

### One-liner for interview

> “etcd is simpler and Kubernetes-native; ZooKeeper is older and mainly used by legacy 
systems like Kafka.”
