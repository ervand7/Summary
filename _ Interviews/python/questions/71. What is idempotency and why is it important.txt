Idempotency = same request processed multiple times → same result.

Why important:
* Retries and duplicates are normal in distributed systems
* Prevents double writes, double charges, repeated actions

How:
* Idempotency keys
* Conditional updates
* Deduplication logic

Key idea:
> Idempotency makes retries safe
