**Description:**
DoS attacks aim to make a smart contract or the entire network unavailable or unusable by
overwhelming it with requests or exploiting vulnerabilities that cause the contract to fail.

**Types of DoS Attacks:**
- **DoS with Revert:** An attacker causes critical functions to revert, blocking legitimate
users.
- **DoS with Block Gas Limit:** Making certain operations excessively gas-consuming to prevent
them from executing.

**Mitigation:**
- **Fail-Safe Coding Practices:** Ensure that critical functions are not dependent on external
calls that can fail.
- **Gas Optimization:** Write efficient code to prevent hitting gas limits.
- **Circuit Breakers:** Implement emergency stop mechanisms to halt operations in case of
detected attacks.
