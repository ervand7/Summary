GIL = a mutex that allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time.

Why it exists:
* Simplifies memory management
* Makes reference counting thread-safe
* Avoids expensive fine-grained locks

Impact:
* CPU-bound threads don’t scale on multiple cores
* I/O-bound threads are mostly unaffected

Key takeaway:
> GIL trades parallelism for simplicity and safety
