## Publish–Subscribe (Pub/Sub) Pattern

Publish–Subscribe (Pub/Sub) is a messaging pattern where publishers send events to topics,
and subscribers receive events from topics they are subscribed to.
Publishers and subscribers are fully decoupled, which improves scalability and flexibility in
distributed systems.

---

## Core Components

* Publisher — produces messages to a topic; unaware of subscribers.
* Subscriber — consumes messages from a topic; unaware of publishers.
* Topic / Channel — logical message stream used for routing.
* Broker — infrastructure that manages topics and message delivery
  (e.g. Kafka, RabbitMQ, Redis Pub/Sub).

---

## Key Properties

* Loose coupling — publishers and subscribers evolve independently.
* Many-to-many — multiple publishers and subscribers per topic.
* Asynchronous communication — non-blocking event delivery.
* Event-driven — systems react to events rather than direct calls.
* Topic-based filtering — subscribers receive only relevant messages.

---

## Benefits

* Scales horizontally (easy to add producers/consumers)
* Simplifies communication (no direct dependencies)
* Improves resilience (producers don’t fail if consumers are down)
* Enables real-time processing

---

## Common Use Cases

* Microservices communication
* Event notifications
* Real-time streams (logs, metrics, feeds)
* Data synchronization
* IoT event ingestion

---

## Important Considerations

* Ordering — may or may not be guaranteed (broker-specific).
* Durability — messages can be transient or persisted.
* Delivery guarantees — at-most-once / at-least-once / exactly-once.
* Security — auth, ACLs, topic isolation.

---

## Typical Implementations

* Apache Kafka — high-throughput, durable event streaming.
* RabbitMQ — flexible message broker with routing patterns.
* Google Pub/Sub — fully managed cloud Pub/Sub.
* Amazon SNS — managed fan-out messaging.

### One-liner (interview-style)

> Pub/Sub decouples event producers from consumers using topics, enabling scalable, asynchronous,
event-driven systems.

If you want, I can:

* compress this to 10 lines for interviews
* contrast Pub/Sub vs Queue vs Event Bus
* explain Kafka-specific Pub/Sub differences (partitions, offsets, consumer groups)
