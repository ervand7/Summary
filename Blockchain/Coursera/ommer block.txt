An **ommer block** (sometimes called an "uncle block" in Ethereum) is a block
that was mined but did not get included in the main blockchain because another
block at the same height (or level) was added to the chain first. Despite not being
part of the main blockchain, ommer blocks still contribute to the security of the network.

### Key Points:
1. **Purpose**: Ommer blocks help to increase the security of the blockchain by
allowing miners who mined blocks that were valid but not included in the main chain
to still receive a partial reward. This mechanism reduces the centralization of mining
power.

2. **Rewards**: The miners of ommer blocks receive a reduced block reward. Additionally,
the miner who includes an ommer block in the main chain (as a reference) also gets a
small reward.

3. **Inclusion in Blocks**: Ethereum allows up to two ommer blocks to be included in a
newly mined block. This helps in increasing the overall efficiency of the network by
recognizing the work done by miners of the ommer blocks.

4. **Impact on Security**: Including ommer blocks helps in preventing centralization by
providing incentives for miners even when their blocks do not make it into the main
chain, thus encouraging a more decentralized mining process.

Ommer blocks are a unique feature of Ethereum and some other blockchains, designed to
make the network more secure and fair by acknowledging the work of miners whose blocks
were not directly included in the main chain.
