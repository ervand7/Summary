In a senior Go developer interview, you may be asked about choosing SQL vs. NoSQL
databases based on specific use cases. Here’s a quick guide on how to explain when
each might be preferable:

### **When to Prefer SQL:**

1. **Complex Queries and Relationships**
   SQL databases are ideal when you need to perform complex queries and manage
   relationships between tables, such as with `JOINs` and aggregations. For example,
   an e-commerce platform managing orders, customers, and inventory would benefit
   from SQL’s relational structure.

2. **Transactional Integrity (ACID Compliance)**
   SQL databases ensure atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID),
   making them reliable for applications requiring strict data integrity, like financial
   systems or inventory management.

3. **Fixed Schema and Predictable Data Structure**
   If your data structure is well-defined and stable, SQL is generally a better choice,
   as it enforces schema and data integrity. Examples include ERP systems or applications
   with consistent record structures.

4. **Reporting and Analytics**
   SQL databases are optimized for aggregating and querying structured data, making
   them suitable for applications that require heavy reporting or analytical processing.

### **When to Prefer NoSQL:**

1. **Scalability and High Write Throughput**
   NoSQL databases (like MongoDB, Cassandra) can handle high write-throughput and are
    horizontally scalable, making them ideal for applications with massive data writes,
    such as social media or IoT data storage.

2. **Flexible or Evolving Schema**
   NoSQL databases allow schema flexibility, so they are better for applications with
   dynamic, unstructured, or semi-structured data. For instance, a content management
   system storing varied document types would benefit from NoSQL.

3. **Handling Large Volumes of Unstructured Data**
   Applications dealing with large-scale unstructured data, such as logs, social media
   posts, or sensor data, often use NoSQL for efficient storage and access.

4. **Geographically Distributed Systems**
   NoSQL databases, especially those with a distributed architecture like Cassandra,
   are suited for globally distributed applications, as they can replicate data across
   multiple locations with minimal latency.

### **Key Interview Points**
- **Trade-offs:** Acknowledge that SQL offers strong consistency, while NoSQL may
provide eventual consistency.
- **Data Access Patterns:** Highlight that the choice often depends on access patterns,
e.g., complex queries favor SQL, while high-speed writes or flexible schema favor NoSQL.
- **Scale Requirements:** Explain the database selection can also depend on expected
scale and data structure variability.

Being able to demonstrate when and why you would choose each database type will
showcase your decision-making skills and technical expertise at the senior level.
