TTL, soft deletes, and archiving

TTL:

* Auto-deletes items after a timestamp
* Asynchronous and eventual

Soft deletes:

* Mark item as deleted with a flag
* Data stays for recovery or audit

Archiving:

* Move old data to S3 or another store
* Reduces DynamoDB size and cost

Interview one-liner:

> TTL expires data automatically, soft deletes keep data with a delete flag, and
archiving moves cold data to cheaper storage like S3.
