The `tokenURI` is a function typically found in ERC-721 (NFT) smart contracts, which
provides a link to metadata associated with a specific token. This metadata usually
contains information such as the token's name, description, image, and other attributes
that help define the uniqueness of the NFT.

### Key Points About `tokenURI`:

1. **Metadata Link**: The `tokenURI` function returns a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier),
which can be a URL pointing to a JSON file that contains the metadata for the token.

2. **Metadata Structure**: The JSON file usually follows a standard structure and includes
fields such as `name`, `description`, `image`, and any other custom attributes the token
might have.

   Example of a typical JSON metadata file:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "CryptoKitty #1",
     "description": "This is the first CryptoKitty",
     "image": "https://example.com/images/cryptokitty1.png",
     "attributes": [
       {
         "trait_type": "color",
         "value": "blue"
       },
       {
         "trait_type": "eye shape",
         "value": "round"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Dynamic or Static**: The URI can be static (a fixed URL) or dynamic (generated
based on the token's ID). Some implementations dynamically generate the metadata URL to
ensure it is unique for each token.

4. **IPFS Use**: Many NFT projects store the metadata and images on decentralized
storage solutions like IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) to ensure that the data remains
accessible and immutable.

### Example of `tokenURI` Function in Solidity:
Here's a simplified example of how the `tokenURI` function might be implemented in a
Solidity smart contract:

```solidity
function tokenURI(uint256 tokenId) public view virtual override returns (string memory) {
    return string(abi.encodePacked(baseURI, Strings.toString(tokenId), ".json"));
}
```

In this example, `baseURI` would be a base path, and `tokenId` is the unique identifier
of the token, which, when combined, forms the complete URI pointing to the token's metadata.

The `tokenURI` function plays a crucial role in defining how NFTs are represented and
what information is associated with them, making it an essential part of the NFT ecosystem.
