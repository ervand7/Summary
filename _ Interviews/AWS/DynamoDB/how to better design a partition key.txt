Design a Partition Key around access patterns and worst-case traffic, not
around entities.

Rules of thumb:

* Aim for high cardinality (many distinct values)
* Ensure even read/write distribution (avoid hot keys)
* Avoid time-based or low-cardinality values
* Don’t use a single high-traffic business key alone
* Distribute writes (UUIDs, sharding, suffixes if needed)
* Use GSIs to support other query patterns
* Design defensively for unknown future load

One-liner:

> A good partition key spreads traffic evenly under the worst-case access pattern.
