## A. Scope (what exactly are we building?)

1. Is this Google Drive-like product for consumers, or an enterprise doc platform?
2. Do we support only file storage + sharing, or also Google Docs-style real-time editing?
3. Are we designing web only, or also mobile + desktop sync client?
4. Do we need “shared drives / team drives” (org-owned folders), or only personal drives?
5. Are folders “real” entities, or just metadata labels (virtual folders)?

## B. Core features (must-haves)

6. What operations are in scope: upload, download, list, move, rename, delete, restore?
7. Do we need file version history (revisions) and rollback?
8. Do we need “Trash” (soft delete), and how long to keep it?
9. Do we need offline access + conflict resolution (“(1) copy”, etc.)?
10. Do we need “changes feed” / incremental sync (“give me all updates since cursor”)?

## C. Sharing & permissions (hard part)

11. Sharing model: links (“anyone with link”), explicit users, groups, domains?
12. Permission levels: viewer/commenter/editor/owner? Any custom roles?
13. Do we need inheritance (folder perms apply to children)?
14. Do we need “public on the internet” indexing, or strictly authenticated access?
15. Do we need audit logs (who accessed/downloaded/changed)?

## D. Scale & performance targets

16. Expected number of users (MAU/DAU)? Average files per user?
17. Expected upload/download QPS? Peak bursts (e.g., Monday mornings)?
18. Typical file sizes: mostly small docs/photos, or large videos (GBs)?
19. Latency targets: list folder < 200ms? download start < 300ms?
20. Multi-region requirement: global product or single region?

## E. Data correctness & reliability

21. Consistency: after upload, should file appear immediately in listing?
22. Versioning behavior: do we allow concurrent edits and merge, or last-write-wins?
23. Durability target: “11 9s” like object storage, or simpler?
24. Disaster recovery: RPO/RTO requirements?
25. Quotas: per-user storage limit? per-file size limit?

## F. Security & compliance

26. Encryption at rest required? Customer-managed keys (KMS)?
27. Antivirus / malware scanning required before sharing/downloading?
28. Data loss prevention (DLP) / sensitive content policies?
29. Legal holds / retention policies (enterprise)?
30. Do we need “download disabled” or watermarking for certain shares?

## G. Search & indexing

31. Search scope: by filename only, or full-text (PDF/DOC) search too?
32. Do we need “type:pdf owner:me modified:today” style filters?
33. How fresh must search be (seconds vs minutes)?

## H. Observability & ops

34. What metrics matter: upload success rate, p95 latency, error codes, bytes transferred?
35. Rate limiting / abuse protection needed (hotlinking big files)?
36. Admin APIs: user suspension, sharing restrictions, quota changes?
