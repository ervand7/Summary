We pause and resume consumption by pausing specific partitions on the
consumer and later resuming them, which temporarily stops fetching records
without leaving the consumer group.


Kafka consumers can call `Pause()` on assigned partitions to apply backpressure or handle
downstream overload, and `Resume()` to continue consuming. This does not trigger a
rebalance and keeps partition ownership.


### Why this is important
* Apply backpressure safely
* Protect downstream systems (DB, APIs)
* Avoid rebalancing storms
* Preserve ordering


### Go example (Sarama-style)
```go
consumer.Pause([]sarama.TopicPartition{
    {Topic: "orders", Partition: 3},
})

// later
consumer.Resume([]sarama.TopicPartition{
    {Topic: "orders", Partition: 3},
})
```


### Key points interviewers expect
* Pause/resume is per partition
* Does not affect other consumers
* Does not revoke partitions
* Lag will grow while paused (that’s OK)


### What not to do
* Don’t stop polling completely (can trigger rebalance)
* Don’t pause forever without monitoring lag


### One-liner to remember
> Pause/resume applies backpressure without rebalancing.
