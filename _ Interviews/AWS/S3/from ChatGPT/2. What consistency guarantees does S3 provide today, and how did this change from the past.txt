Short answer:

Today (since 2020):
Amazon S3 provides strong read-after-write consistency for all operations:

* `PUT` (new objects)
* `PUT` (overwrite existing objects)
* `DELETE`
* `LIST`

➡️ Once a write or delete succeeds, all subsequent reads and listings immediately reflect it.

In the past:

* Strong consistency only for new object PUTs
* Eventual consistency for overwrites, deletes, and LIST
  (you could temporarily see stale data)

Key takeaway:

> Modern S3 behaves like a strongly consistent object store, eliminating race conditions
that older designs had to work around.
