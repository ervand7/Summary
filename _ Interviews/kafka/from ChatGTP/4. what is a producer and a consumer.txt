* Producer – an application that publishes messages to Kafka topics
* Consumer – an application that reads messages from Kafka topics

A producer sends records to Kafka and chooses a topic and partition (explicitly or
via a key).
A consumer polls records from Kafka, processes them, and tracks progress using offsets.

> Producers write to the log, consumers read from the log.
