An Ethereum private key must meet the following criteria:

- **256-Bit Integer**: It is a 256-bit (32-byte) number, typically represented as a
64-character hexadecimal string.
- **Valid Range**: Must be a number between 1 and \( n - 1 \), where \( n \) is the order
of the secp256k1 elliptic curve (approximately \(1.158 \times 10^{77}\)).
- **Secure Generation**: Should be generated using a cryptographically secure random number
generator to ensure uniqueness and unpredictability.

**Example of a Private Key as a 256-Bit Integer**:

```
102741580789075306422722474761575122873980036356615948096780904167450780261042
```

This integer corresponds to the hexadecimal private key:

```
