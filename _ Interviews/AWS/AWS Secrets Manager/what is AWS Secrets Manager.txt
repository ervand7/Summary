AWS Secrets Manager is for secure storage and rotation of secrets.

What to know:

* Stores DB passwords, API keys, tokens
* Secrets are encrypted with KMS (by default). It means secrets are stored encrypted, and
 KMS manages the encryption keys.
* Access controlled via IAM. It means IAM decides who can read or modify a secret.
* Supports automatic rotation (via Lambda written by you).
* Can be cached in Lambda to reduce latency & cost
* Costs money (unlike basic SSM)

👉 Use it for real secrets, not config.
