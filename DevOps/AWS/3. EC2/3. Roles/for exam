 - Using roles - is preferred option for security perspective.

 - Avoid hard-coding your credentials. Roles allow you to provide access without
 the use of access keyIDs and secret access keys

 - Policies control a role's permissions

 - Updates. You can attach and detach roles to running EC2 instances without having to
 stop or terminate those instances

Usage:
Using roles with Amazon EC2 allows instances to securely make
API requests without managing static API credentials. Roles provide temporary
permissions that are automatically rotated and assigned to the EC2 instance,
improving security by reducing the risk of credential leakage and simplifying
credential management. This approach adheres to the best practice of least
privilege, ensuring that applications have only the permissions they
need to operate.
