Kafka has two different broker roles:

Kafka Controller
- One broker per cluster
- Manages cluster state
- Tracks brokers and partitions
- Elects partition leaders
- Handles broker failures
- Does NOT manage consumers or rebalancing

Schema:
Kafka Cluster
│
├─ Broker 1  ← Controller
│    ├─ Knows all brokers
│    ├─ Knows all partitions
│    ├─ Elects leaders
│    └─ Handles broker failures
│
├─ Broker 2
├─ Broker 3
└─ Broker 4


Consumer Group Coordinator
- One broker per consumer group
- Manages consumer group state
- Triggers consumer rebalance
- Assigns partitions to consumers
- Stores and manages offsets
- Does NOT manage brokers or cluster topology

Schema:
Consumer Group A
│
├─ Consumer 1 ──┐
├─ Consumer 2 ──┼── Coordinator (Broker 3)
├─ Consumer 3 ──┘
│
└─ Partitions:
    P0 → Consumer 1
    P1 → Consumer 2
    P2 → Consumer 3


Key distinction
- Controller = cluster & partitions
- Coordinator = consumers & rebalance

One-liner
> Controller manages the Kafka cluster; Coordinator manages consumer groups.
