Because of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).

Why:
* Only one thread can execute Python bytecode at a time
* CPU-bound threads compete for the GIL
* Threads are context-switched, not run in parallel

Result:
* Multiple cores are not fully utilized

Key takeaway:
> Python threads don’t provide true CPU parallelism
