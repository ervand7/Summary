concurrent.futures provides a high-level API for running tasks concurrently.

How it works:
* Uses executors to manage worker pools
  - ThreadPoolExecutor → threads
  - ProcessPoolExecutor → processes
* You submit callables with submit()
* Returns Future objects
* Futures represent running or completed tasks

Key idea:
> Executor manages workers, Future represents result


```
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def work(x):
    return x * 2

with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
    future = executor.submit(work, 10)
    print(future.result())
```
