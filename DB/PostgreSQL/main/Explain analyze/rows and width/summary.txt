Example: `rows=9918 width=30`

In the PostgreSQL `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` output, the `rows` and `width` values provide
information about the estimated number of rows and the average row width that will be
processed by each step of the query plan.

- **`rows`**: This represents the estimated number of rows that will be processed by a
particular step of the query plan. In your example, it indicates that this step is expected
to process approximately 9,918 rows.

- **`width`**: This represents the estimated average width (in bytes) of each row processed
by that step. In your example, it indicates that each row is estimated to be 30 bytes
wide on average.

These values are used by the query planner to estimate the cost of processing rows at
each step and to choose the most efficient execution plan based on these estimates.

It's important to note that these values are estimates and may not always match the actual
number of rows or row widths encountered during query execution. The `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`
output also provides the `actual` information (e.g., `actual time`, `actual rows`) to
show the real values observed during query execution, which can be more accurate
for performance analysis.
