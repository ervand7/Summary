NGINX is a high-performance web server and reverse proxy commonly used as the front
door of modern web and microservice architectures.

### Why NGINX is widely used

### 1️⃣ Reverse proxy & traffic control
* Routes client requests to backend services and hides internal infrastructure.
* Centralizes concerns like TLS termination, authentication, caching, and headers.

### 2️⃣ Load balancing
* Distributes traffic across multiple backends to improve availability and throughput.
* Supports algorithms such as round-robin, least connections, and IP hash.

### 3️⃣ High concurrency & performance
* Built on an event-driven, non-blocking architecture, allowing it to handle tens of
  thousands of concurrent connections efficiently.
* Very low memory and CPU overhead compared to thread-based servers.

### 4️⃣ Static content serving
* Serves static assets (CSS, JS, images) directly, reducing load on application servers
  and improving response times.

### 5️⃣ SSL/TLS termination
* Handles encryption at the edge, simplifying certificate management and reducing
  CPU load on backend services.

### 6️⃣ Caching
* Caches frequently requested responses to reduce backend load, improve latency,
  and increase resilience during partial outages.

### 7️⃣ Security & traffic protection
* Provides built-in rate limiting, connection limiting, IP filtering, and header controls.
* Often used as the first protection layer against abuse and DDoS-like traffic patterns.

### 8️⃣ Modern protocol support
* Supports HTTP/2 and WebSocket, enabling efficient multiplexing and real-time
  communication.

### 9️⃣ Observability & debugging
* Offers detailed access and error logs, including upstream status and timing, which are
  critical for debugging production issues.
