**EIP-191** and **EIP-712** are both Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) that define
standards for how messages are signed and verified within Ethereum, but they serve slightly
different purposes and have different levels of complexity.

### EIP-191 (Ethereum Signed Messages)
EIP-191 is a simple proposal for signing messages in a specific format. It standardizes the
process for signing messages that are **not transactions**. The signature includes a specific
prefix that ensures the signed message cannot be misinterpreted as a transaction. This is
important to prevent replay attacks.

#### Key Points:
- **Prefixing**: The standard includes a prefix (`"\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\n"`),
followed by the length of the message. This ensures that the signature refers to a plain
message and not to a transaction.
- **Applications**: It's used in simple signing schemes where the message is just a string
or data that doesn't need complex structuring or encoding.

### EIP-712 (Ethereum Typed Data)
EIP-712 is more complex than EIP-191 and is designed to provide a secure and standardized way
to sign **structured data**. It allows for the creation of typed data structures that can be
signed and verified on-chain. This provides better security guarantees and makes the
signatures easier to verify, especially when dealing with smart contracts.

#### Key Points:
- **Typed Structured Data**: You define data with types, ensuring clarity about what is being
signed. This is useful for more complex applications like decentralized finance (DeFi)
protocols, where the signing data includes various fields and types.
- **Domain Separator**: It includes a domain separator to prevent cross-domain attacks,
where the same data could be valid in one context but malicious in another.
- **JSON-like Data Signing**: EIP-712 enables signing complex data structures, similar to
JSON objects, making it versatile for more sophisticated use cases, like DAO proposals or
financial transactions.
