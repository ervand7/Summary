In Go, `database/sql` manages a connection pool, not a single connection.

How it works:

* `sql.DB` is a pool manager
* Connections are opened lazily
* Queries borrow a connection from the pool
* After use, the connection is returned

Key points:

* `sql.DB` is safe for concurrent use
* You should create one `sql.DB` per database
* Configure pool size with:

  * `SetMaxOpenConns`
  * `SetMaxIdleConns`
  * `SetConnMaxLifetime`

One-liner (interview-ready):

> In Go, `sql.DB` is a concurrent-safe connection pool that manages DB connections
automatically.
