👉 Graceful degradation means the system continues to work in a limited but controlled
way instead of failing completely.

What graceful degradation looks like:
* Core functionality remains available
* Non-critical features are disabled
* Responses may be partial, cached, or less fresh
* System stays responsive under overload

How to design it:
* Identify critical vs optional paths (payments vs analytics, core data vs recommendations)
* Use timeouts and fail-fast behavior on non-critical dependencies
* Fallbacks — cached data, defaults, or simplified responses
* Feature flags — dynamically disable expensive features
* Rate limiting — shed excess traffic early

Under high RPS or partial failures:
* Expensive calls are skipped
* Background work is delayed or dropped
* System prioritizes availability over completeness

Key insight:
* Users prefer a degraded response over a timeout
* Degradation must be intentional, not accidental

One-line interview answer:
> Graceful degradation is designed by identifying critical paths, failing fast on
non-essential work, using fallbacks and caching, and shedding load so the system
remains responsive under high RPS.
