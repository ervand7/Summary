Common Python performance pitfalls:

* Writing CPU-heavy loops in pure Python
* Excessive object creation
* Blocking I/O in async code
* Inefficient data structures
* Repeated work without caching
* Overusing threads for CPU-bound tasks
* Unnecessary abstraction layers

Key idea:
> Python is fast enough — misuse makes it slow
