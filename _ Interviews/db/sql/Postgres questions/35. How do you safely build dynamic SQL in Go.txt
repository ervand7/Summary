You build dynamic SQL safely by never interpolating user input into SQL strings.

Correct approaches:

* Use parameterized queries (`$1`, `$2`, …)
* Build SQL structure dynamically, but pass values as parameters
* Use query builders when needed

Example (safe):

```go
query := "SELECT * FROM users WHERE status = $1"
rows, err := db.Query(query, status)
```

Dynamic filters (safe pattern):

```go
query := "SELECT * FROM users WHERE 1=1"
args := []any{}

if email != "" {
    query += " AND email = $1"
    args = append(args, email)
}
```

Avoid ❌:

```go
query := "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '" + email + "'"
```

One-liner (interview-ready):

> Dynamic SQL is safe when structure is dynamic but values are always passed
as parameters, never interpolated.
