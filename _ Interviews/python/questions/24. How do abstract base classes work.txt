Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) define required methods.

How they work:
* Use abc.ABC as base class
* Mark methods with @abstractmethod
* Cannot instantiate until all abstract methods are implemented

Purpose:
* Enforce interfaces
* Catch design errors early


> ABCs define what a class must implement
