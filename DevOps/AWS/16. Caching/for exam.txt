Whenever possible, pick an answer that includes a caching solution.
If you see a question about in-memory database, think about Redis or DynamoDB.
Backups are not supported on any solutions besides Redis. Memcached or DAX
are not solutions in this case.

================================== CloudFront ===============================
CloudFront is a CDN (content delivery network). Caching and distribution via
HTTP and HTTPS protocols.
CloudFront caches content at the edge locations to speed up delivery of data.
CloudFront fixes all connection issues.
This CDN works for both AWS and on-site architecture.
It can be used to block individual countries, but the WAF is a better tool for it.
All the locations. You cannot pick specific edge locations for your distributions.

CloudFront is tho only option to add HTTPS to a static website beeng hosted
in S3 bucket.

================================== ElastiCache and DAX ===============================
On the exam favor answers that include a database caching solution.
Redis can be more than just a cache - ot can be a standalone database as well.

Redis and Memcached are supported by ElastiCache.

DAX is designed to sit in front of DynamoDB.

================================== Global Accelerator ===============================
Both Route 53 and Global Accelerator can create weights for application endpoints.

For any scenarios about IP caching, favor Global Accelerator.
You are provided two Anycast IP addresses.
Uses edge locations to help speed everything up.
Meant for TCP and UDT traffic (e.g. gaming apps, IoT messaging)
