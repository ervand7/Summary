PostgreSQL handles transactions using MVCC + WAL.

Internally:

* Each transaction gets a transaction ID (XID)
* Changes create new row versions (old ones stay visible to others)
* WAL records changes for durability
* On COMMIT → WAL is flushed to disk
* On ROLLBACK → new versions are ignored

Key idea:

> Transactions see a consistent snapshot without blocking others.

One-liner (interview-ready):

> PostgreSQL uses MVCC for isolation and WAL for durability to implement transactions.
