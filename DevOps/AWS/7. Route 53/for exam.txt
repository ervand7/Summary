Route 53 is Amazon DNS service.
Route 53 allows you to register a domain programmatically.

CNAME
Can not be used for naked domain names (zone apex record). You can't have CNAME
for http://acloudguru.com
If at the exam you have choice between alias record and CNAME always choose an
alias record over CNAME.
Common DNS record types: SOA Record, CNAME Record, NS records, A records.


Record Alias can be used for a naked domain name.


Registering a Domain name.
 - You can buy domain names directly with AWS
 - It can take up to 3 days to register depending on the circumstances


Simple Routing Policy.
If you choose the simple routing policy, you can only have one record with multiple IP
addresses. If you specify multiple values in a record, Route 53 returns all values
to the user in a random order.


Weighted Routing Policy.
If you see a scenario based question where it's talking about sending a certain
amount of traffic, a percentage to various different geographic locations,
think of Weighted Routing.


Health Checks.
It's a test that allows you to determine if your endpoint is online.
 - You can set health checks on individual record sets
 - If a record set fails a health check, it will be removed from route 53
 until it passed the heath check
 - You can set SNS notifications to alert you about failed health checks


Failover Routing Policy.
With DNS failover, if a record set fails a health check, it will be removed from
the Route 53 response until it passes the health check.
If you see a scenario based question where it's talking about active/passive
or about backup, think of Failover Routing Policy.


Geolocation Routing Policy.
If you see a scenario based question where you've got your users in different
parts of the world, and you need to control where you're going to send them
based in their location, think of Geolocation Routing Policy.


Geoproximity Routing Policy.
Geoproximity Routing lets Amazon Route 53 route traffic to your resources based
on the geographic location of your users and resources.
 - You can also optionally choose to route more traffic or less to a given
 resource by specifying a value, known as a bias. A bias expands or shrinks the
 size of the geographic region from which traffic is routed to a resource
 - To use Geoproximity Routing, you must use Route 53 traffic flow.


TTL control.
This is the time to live, and it controls how long a DNS record will be cached.


7 routing policies available with Route 53:
1. **Simple Routing Policy**:
   - Basic routing where a single resource is returned.
   - Commonly used when you have a single resource that performs a given function for your domain.

2. **Weighted Routing Policy**:
   - Distributes traffic across multiple resources based on specified weights.
   - Useful for load balancing and testing new versions of an application.

3. **Latency Routing Policy**:
   - Routes traffic to the resource that provides the best latency for the user.
   - Ideal for improving user experience by reducing response time.

4. **Failover Routing Policy**:
   - Configures active-passive failover.
   - Routes traffic to a primary resource unless it is unavailable, then it routes to a secondary resource.

5. **Geolocation Routing Policy**:
   - Routes traffic based on the geographic location of the user.
   - Useful for serving localized content and complying with legal or regulatory requirements.

6. **Geoproximity Routing Policy**:
   - Routes traffic based on the geographic location of resources and users, and optionally shifts traffic from
   resources in one location to resources in another location.
   - Requires Route 53 Traffic Flow.

7. **Multi-Value Answer Routing Policy**:
   - Similar to simple routing, but with a healthcheck. It allows multiple values for
   each DNS query response.
   - Ideal for routing traffic to multiple resources, for example, to improve availability.

These policies can be used individually or in combination to provide sophisticated DNS routing strategies.
