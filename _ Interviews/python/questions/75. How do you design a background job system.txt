A background job system runs tasks asynchronously outside request flow.

Basic design:
* Producer enqueues jobs
* Queue/broker stores jobs (SQS, Redis, Kafka)
* Workers consume and execute jobs
* Retries + DLQ for failures
* Idempotent job handlers

Key concerns:
* Reliability
* Retries
* Monitoring

Key idea:
> Offload slow or unreliable work from user requests
