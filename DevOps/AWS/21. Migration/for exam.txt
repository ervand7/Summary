Where are we going?
How do we get there?
Is it all at once?
Or is it a partial migration?

================================== Snow Family ===============================
Snowball. Are perfect for moving many terabytes of data.
Storage, Compute and GPU. Can hold up to 81 TB of data.
Pick Snowball if you see this scenario: Not beeng able to transfer over the internet,
having a large amount of data or having a very slow internet connection

Snowcone. Small, robust edge computing. Can hold up to 8 tb of data.

Snowmobile. Up to 100 PB in a very large truck.

Both Ways. The Snow Family works to get data into AWS, as well as shipped back to you.

Timing. Generally, turnaround is a week, but that mostly depends on the customer.

Snowball Edge.
The AWS Snowball Edge is a type of Snowball device with on-board storage and
compute power for select AWS capabilities. Snowball Edge can undertake local
processing and edge-computing workloads in addition to transferring data
between your local environment and the AWS Cloud.

================================== Storage Gateway ===============================
Storage Gateway is a hybrid solution.
Anytime on-premises storage is mentioned, you should be thinking about which
type of Storage Gateway can complement the existing architecture.

About Storage Gateway types:
 - NFS service is out of storage? - pick File Gateway
 - I am darling to deal with tape backups? - pick Tape Gateway

================================== DataSync ===============================
DataSync is Migration service for one-time migration.
It is the best choice for transferring large amounts of data between on-premises
storage, edge locations, other clouds, and AWS Storage services.

It is agent based. An agent needs to be installed on the architecture on
your end to get it into AWS.
BUT!!! An agent is not required when transferring between AWS storage services
in the same AWS account.

Endpoints. S3 EFS and FSx are all supported locations for your data.

================================== AWS Transfer Family ===============================
The easiest way to change nothing. The AWS Transfer Family excels when you have
a collection of older applications using protocols that cannot be changed. You can
easily "trick" these applications into using S3 storage.
If you see anything FTP related, pick Transfer Family.

Legacy. This tool excels with bringing legacy application storage to the cloud.

FTPS, SFTP - that's from outside of your AWS environment in.

DNS. The DNS entry stays tge same, but the location for the storage becomes S3.

================================== Migration Hub ===============================
Migration Hub is an organisational tool that gives you a way to organize all your steps.
You will need other tools to complete the migration through.

DMS is going to be used to move databases.
SMS (Server Migration Service) will be the tool for moving servers (if you have VMs)
Migration Hub will give you the overview you need.

Magic. One the exam, these tools will solve all application migration needs.

Schema conversion. It's easy to migrate to Aurora or RDS.

Focus on answers that include doing a complete migration

========== AWS Application Discovery Service or AWS Application Migration Service ===========
AWS Application Discovery Service.
 - For easily and quickly migrate applications to the AWS Cloud.
 - Agentless discovery performed via OVA file in vCenter. Easy migration of VMs.
 - Agent-base discovery. Installable agent for Windows and Linux to collect detailed
 information on VMs and physical hosts.

AWS Application Migration Service (also known as AWS MGN):
 - Automated lift and shift of migrating infrastructure to AWS.
 - Replication. Replicate source services (VMs, physical or cloud servers)
 into AWS for non-disruptive cutovers.
 - RTO and RPO. RTO is measured in minutes, depending on OS boot time. RPO is measures
 in sub-seconds

=========================== AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) =======================
It allows for easy migration of relational databases, NoSQL databases, data warehouses
and other data stores to AWS.
It works for on-premises to the cloud or for moving data between different RDS databases.

DMS server runs replication software that executes specified tasks.

One of the endpoints must be within AWS. You cannot leverage this for external-only
migrations.

SCT (Schema Conversion Tool) allows you to convert database schemas to a new or
different target database schema.
Example of usage:
To convert an Oracle database to a format compatible with Amazon Aurora
for a database migration.

Snowball. You can migrate massive databases to AWS more efficiently by using Snowball
devices with DMS.
