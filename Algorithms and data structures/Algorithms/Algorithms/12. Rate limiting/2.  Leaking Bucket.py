# Simple idea:
# Imagine a bucket where water (requests) is poured in randomly but leaks out at
# a fixed rate (e.g., 1 drop per second).
# If too much water is poured in too quickly and the bucket overflows â€” the extra
# water (requests) is discarded.
#
# So, it smooths out bursts and ensures a constant, steady rate of processing.
