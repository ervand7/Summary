👉 Load balancing is the process of distributing incoming traffic across multiple
service instances so that no single instance becomes a bottleneck or point of failure.


### Why load balancing is needed in high-load systems

1. One server has hard limits
* CPU, memory, file descriptors, network bandwidth are finite
* A single Go process can handle many requests, but not infinite ones
* At some RPS, latency spikes and failures start


2. It prevents overload and cascading failures
* Without load balancing, traffic concentrates on a few instances
* Overloaded instances become slow
* Slow instances hold goroutines longer
* Goroutines pile up → memory & GC pressure → crash


3. It enables horizontal scaling
* Multiple identical service instances run in parallel
* Load balancer spreads requests across them
* Capacity increases roughly linearly with instance count

4. It improves availability and fault tolerance
* If one instance crashes, traffic is sent to healthy ones
* Users don’t see downtime
* Rolling deploys become possible


5. It isolates failures
* A slow or misbehaving instance affects only its share of traffic
* The system degrades gracefully instead of collapsing


### One-sentence interview answer
> Load balancing distributes traffic across multiple instances to prevent overload,
enable horizontal scaling, and improve availability in high-load systems.


### Go-specific insight (very important)
> Go’s goroutines make a single instance *appear* scalable, but without load balancing
you eventually hit CPU, memory, connection pool, or downstream limits.
