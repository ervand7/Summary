Signed URL = a normal CDN URL with:

* expiration time
* cryptographic signature

It allows the CDN to serve private video content without calling the backend.

---

### Typical (best-practice) flow

1. Backend authorizes playback
   * checks user, geo, entitlement

2. Backend returns a signed manifest URL
   (or sets a signed cookie)

```json
{
  "manifest_url": "https://cdn.example.com/movie.mpd?exp=1735203600&sig=abc"
}
```

3. Player downloads the manifest

4. Player downloads video chunks

```http
GET /720/seg_001.ts
GET /720/seg_002.ts
```

5. CDN authorizes each chunk

* using the same signature or cookie
* no backend involved

---

### Important clarifications

* ✅ Every chunk is authorized
* ❌ Chunks are usually NOT individually signed
* ✅ Authorization is inherited from:

  * signed manifest or
  * signed CDN cookie

---

### Why this design is used

* avoids signing thousands of URLs
* scales to millions of users
* keeps backend off the hot path

---

### One-sentence senior summary

> Video chunks are authorized by the CDN using a signed manifest or signed cookies, so 
each chunk request is validated without backend involvement.
