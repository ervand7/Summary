👉 Offsets are tracked per *consumer group + partition*, NOT per individual consumer.

* Kafka stores offsets like this:
  ```
  (consumer_group, topic, partition) → offset
  ```
* Not `(consumer_group, consumer_id, partition)`


* ✔️ The consumer client is responsible for:
  * tracking progress
  * committing offsets (auto or manual)
* ❌ But offsets are not owned permanently by a specific consumer
  * they belong to the group

Interview-ready sentence:
> Kafka tracks offsets per consumer group and partition; individual consumers may
change, but the group offset remains the source of truth.
