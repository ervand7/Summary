Idempotency = same event processed multiple times → same result.

Why needed in Lambda:

* Retries and duplicate deliveries are normal
* Without it → double charges, duplicate rows, repeated emails

How to do it:

* Use a stable idempotency key (event/message ID)
* Store it in DynamoDB with a conditional write
* If key exists → return previous result
* Make downstream writes idempotent too (UPSERT, stable IDs)

Interview one-liner:

> I assume retries, store an idempotency key with a conditional write, and return
the stored result on duplicates to avoid double side effects.

👉 Retries are normal; duplicates must be harmless.
