 Project description:
  - artifacts - contains compiled contract artifacts, including the 
  contract's ABI (Application Binary Interface), bytecode, and other 
  metadata necessary for interacting with the smart contracts.

  - cache - contains temporary files generated during the compilation 
  and deployment process. This includes cache data that speeds up 
  subsequent compilations by storing intermediate results and other 
  data that Hardhat uses internally to optimize the build process.

  - contracts - our contracts and tests
  - deploy - our hardhat deploy scripts
  - .solhint.json - for linting
