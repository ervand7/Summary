 - VPC is a logical data center in AWS

 - Consists of gateways (or virtual private gateways), route tables, network
 access control lists, subnets, and security groups

 - 1 subnet is always in 1 AZ

 - subnet is basically virtual firewall

 What we can do with VPC?
 - Launch instances into a subnet of your choosing
 - Assign custom IP addresses ranges in each subnet
 - Configure route tables between subnets
 - Create internet gateway and attach it to our VPC
 - Mach better security control over your AWS resources
 - Subnet network access lists
 - You can use network access control lists (NACLs) to clock specific IP addresses

 Nat (Network Address Translation) Gateways - used to enable instances in private subnet
 to connect to the internet or other AWS services while preventing the internet
 from initiating a connection with those instances.
 - Redundant inside the AZ
 - Starts at 5 GBps and scales currently to 45 GBps
 - No need to patch
 - Not associated with security group
 - Automatically assigned a public IP address


Security groups:
 - Security groups are stateful. If you send a request from your instance,
 the response traffic for that request is allowed to flow in regardless of
 inbound security group rules
 - Responses to allowed inbound traffic are allowed to flow out, regardless
 of outbound rules


Network ACL:
 - Default Network ACLs. Your VPC comes with default network ACL. And by default
 it allows all outbound and inbound traffic
 - Custom Network ACLs. You can create custom Network ACLs. By default, each
 custom network ACL denies all inbound and outbound traffic until you add rules
 - Subnet associations. Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a network ACL.
 If you don't explicitly associate a subnet with a network ACL, the subnet is
 automatically associated with the default network ACL.
 - Block IP Addresses. Block IP Addresses using network ACLs, not security groups.
 - You can associate network ACL with multiple subnets; however a subnet can
 be associated with only 1 network ACL at a time. When you associate a network ACL with
 a subnet, the previous association is removed
 - Network ACLs contain a numbered list of rules that are evaluated in order, starting
 with the lowest numbered rule
 - Network ACLs have separate inbound and outbound rules, and each rule can
 either allow or deny traffic
 - Network ACLs are stateless; responses to allowed inbound traffic are subject
 to the rules for outbound traffic (and vice versa).
