👉 A consumer group is a set of consumers that work together to process messages
from a topic in parallel.

Why it’s needed:
* Enables horizontal scaling of message processing
* Each partition is consumed by only one consumer within the group
* Prevents duplicate processing inside the same group

How it works:
* Kafka assigns partitions to consumers in the group
* If a consumer joins/leaves, Kafka rebalances partitions
* Offsets are tracked per consumer group

One-line interview answer:
> A consumer group allows multiple consumers to share the work of processing topic
partitions while maintaining ordered, non-duplicate consumption within the group.
