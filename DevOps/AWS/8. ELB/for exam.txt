Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers different types of Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs):
1. **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**:
The load balancer routes requests only to the healthy instances. When the load
balancer determines that an instance is unhealthy, it stops routing requests to
that instance.
 - Application Load Balancers can be configured to use static IPs by partnering with
 a Network Load Balancer.
 - Listeners. A listener checks for connection requests from clients, using the protocol
and port you configure.
 - Rules. Determine how the load balancer routes requests to its registered targets.
Each rule consists of a priority, one or more actions, and one or more conditions
 - Target groups. Each target group routes requests to one or more registered targets,
 such as EC2 instances, using the protocol and port number you specify.
 - Limitations. Application Load Balancer only support HTTP and HTTPS
 - HTTPS. To use an HTTPS listener, you must deploy at least ane SSL/TLS server certificate
 on your load balancer. The load balancer user a server certificate to terminate
 the frontend connection and then decrypt requests from clients before sending
 them to the targets.
 - We can enable sticky session for Application Load Balancer, but the traffic will
 be sent at the target group level
 - Use if you need to route traffic based on the contents of the request

   - Best suited for HTTP and HTTPS traffic.
   - Operates at the application layer (Layer 7) of the OSI model.
   - Supports advanced routing features such as path-based routing, host-based routing,
   and routing based on query string or header values.
   - Ideal for microservices and container-based applications.

2. **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**:
 - Can decrypt traffic, but you will need to install the certificate on the load balancer.
 - When the NLB has only unhealthy registered targets, the Network Load Balancer routes
 requests to all the registered targets, known as fail-open mode.
   - Best suited for TCP, UDP, and TLS traffic where extreme performance is required.
   - Operates at the transport layer (Layer 4) of the OSI model.
   - Capable of handling millions of requests per second while maintaining ultra-low latencies.
   - Ideal for applications that require extreme performance and static IP addresses.

3. **Classic Load Balancer (CLB)**:
 - 504 error means the gateway has timed out. This means the application is not responding
within the idle timeout period.
 - Troubleshoot the application. Is it the web server or database server?
 - Need the IPv4 address of your user? Look for the X-Forwarder-For header.

   - The original AWS ELB, best suited for applications that were built within the
   EC2-Classic network.
   - Operates at both the application layer (Layer 7) and the transport layer (Layer 4).
   - Supports both HTTP/HTTPS and TCP protocols.
   - Recommended for simple load balancing of applications that were created in the
   EC2-Classic network, but it's generally being phased out in favor of ALB and NLB.

4. **Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)**:
   - **Purpose**: Designed for deploying, scaling, and managing third-party virtual
   appliances such as firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and deep
   packet inspection systems.
   - **Operation Layer**: Operates at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model.
   - **Features**:
     - Combines the functions of a transparent network gateway and a load balancer.
     - Ensures that traffic is directed to the appropriate virtual appliance and then
     returned to the same flow.
     - Supports both TCP and UDP traffic.
     - Provides high availability and scalability for network virtual appliances.
   - **Use Cases**: Ideal for security applications where you need to inspect and filter
   traffic before it reaches its destination, enabling easier deployment of security
   services in a scalable and resilient manner.


Health checks:
 - You can use health checks to route your traffic to instances or targets that are healthy.
 - What benefit do you get from configuring health checks on an ELB load balancer?
Instances that fail the health check will not receive traffic.


Sticky sessions.
 - Sticky sessions enable your user to stick to the same EC2 instance. It can be useful
 if you are storing information locally to that instance.
 - You can see a scenario-based question where you remove an EC2 instance from a pool,
 but the load balancer continues to direct traffic to that EC2 instance. To solve this
 scenario, disable sticky sessions


Deregistration Delay.
 - Enable Deregistration Delay: Keep existing connections open if the EC2 instance
becomes unhealthy.
 - Disable Deregistration Delay: Do this if you want your load balancer to immediately
 close connections to the instances that are de-registering or have become unhealthy.
