👉 You manually set the number of Kafka brokers.
Replication factor does NOT create brokers automatically.

Clear separation:

* Brokers → number of servers you deploy (manual: VMs, pods, containers)
* Replication factor → how many brokers each partition is copied to

Rule of thumb:

* `replication.factor = N` requires at least N brokers
* Kafka will fail topic creation if brokers < replication factor

One-line interview answer:

> Kafka brokers are provisioned manually; replication factor only controls how many
existing brokers store replicas.
