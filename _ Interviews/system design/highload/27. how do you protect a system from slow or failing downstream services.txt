👉 By isolating failures and applying backpressure, so slow dependencies don’t 
take down the whole system.

Primary protection mechanisms:
* Timeouts — limit how long you wait on downstream calls
* Circuit breakers — stop sending requests to failing services
* Retries with limits — retry carefully, with backoff and caps

Concurrency & load control:
* Bound goroutines and worker pools
* Limit concurrent calls to downstream services
* Fail fast when limits are reached

Why this matters under high RPS:
* Slow dependencies increase latency
* Higher latency increases concurrency
* Without protection, requests pile up and cause cascading failures

Key insight:
* The system must slow down or shed load when dependencies slow down
* Protecting downstreams protects the whole system

One-line interview answer:
> You protect a system from slow or failing downstream services using timeouts, circuit
breakers, bounded concurrency, and fallbacks, so failures are isolated instead of
causing cascading overload.
