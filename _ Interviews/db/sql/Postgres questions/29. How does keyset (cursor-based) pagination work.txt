Keyset (cursor-based) pagination uses the last seen value as a cursor 
instead of `OFFSET`.

Example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE id > :last_id
ORDER BY id
LIMIT 20;
```

Why it’s better:

* Uses indexes efficiently
* Constant-time performance
* Stable under inserts/deletes

Trade-off:

* Can’t jump to arbitrary pages
* Requires a stable sort key

One-liner (interview-ready):

> Keyset pagination uses a cursor value instead of OFFSET, making pagination fast
and consistent.
