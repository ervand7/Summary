Both B-trees and balanced binary trees aim to maintain balance within their
structures, but they differ significantly in terms of architecture and use cases.

**B-Tree (self-balancing tree):**
1. **Node Structure:** B-trees are designed to store multiple keys and values
in each node, unlike binary trees, which typically store only one key in each node.
2. **Balancing:** B-trees are self-balancing, ensuring that the height of the
tree remains relatively constant. This self-balancing property helps maintain
efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations, even in the face of dynamic data.
3. **Usage:** B-trees are commonly used in file systems and databases, where
they provide efficient storage and retrieval for large datasets. The ability
to handle multiple keys in each node makes them well-suited for storage systems.

**Balanced Binary Tree:**
1. **Node Structure:** In a balanced binary tree, each node has at most two
children (left and right), and it stores a single key.
2. **Balancing:** The balancing of a binary tree is typically achieved by
ensuring that the left and right subtrees of any node have similar heights.
Common types of balanced binary trees include AVL trees and Red-Black trees.
3. **Usage:** Balanced binary trees are often used in in-memory data structures
where quick search, insertion, and deletion operations are required. They are
prevalent in scenarios where the dataset fits in memory and dynamic updates
are frequent.

In summary, B-trees are optimized for external storage and disk-based systems,
where large datasets are managed efficiently. On the other hand, balanced
binary trees are well-suited for in-memory scenarios with dynamic data that
requires efficient access and modification operations. The choice between
them depends on the specific requirements of the application or system.
