### Product / scope (what “gateway” means here)

* Is this gateway mainly routing (edge proxy), or also auth + rate limiting + policy?
* Is it for internal microservices, public APIs, or both?
* Do we need request/response transformation (JSON ↔ gRPC, headers/body mapping)?
* Do we need API versioning (`/v1`, `/v2`) and backward compatibility?
* Do we support multi-tenant (different customers / orgs) with different policies?
* Any monetization / plans (free/pro/enterprise quotas)?
* Do we need developer portal features (API keys, docs, usage stats)?

### Clients / protocols

* What protocols: HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, gRPC, WebSockets, SSE?
* Do we terminate TLS at the gateway? Mutual TLS (mTLS) to upstream?
* Do we need CORS handling for browsers?

### Traffic / scale (numbers drive design)

* Expected RPS (average and peak)? Burstiness (x10 spikes)?
* Number of routes/services behind it (10 / 100 / 1000)?
* Latency target for gateway overhead (p99 budget)? e.g. “gateway adds < 5–10ms”
* Availability target (99.9 / 99.99)? Multi-region required?
* Typical payload sizes (small JSON vs large uploads)?
* Are there long-lived connections (SSE/WebSockets)? How many concurrent?

### Routing / discovery

* How do we route: path-based, host-based, method, headers?
* How do services register: Kubernetes service discovery, Consul, static config?
* Do we need canary / blue-green routing and traffic splitting by %?
* Do we need A/B testing or header-based routing?

### Security / authn / authz

* What auth types: JWT, opaque tokens (introspection), API keys, OAuth2?
* Where is authorization decided: gateway only, or also service-level checks?
* Need RBAC/ABAC policies? (per route, per tenant, per method)
* DDoS/WAF needs? IP allow/deny lists? Geo blocking?

### Reliability / resilience

* Rate limiting: per IP, per user, per API key, per tenant, per route?
* Need timeouts, retries, circuit breakers, bulkheads at gateway?
* Idempotency requirements for retries (e.g., POST)?
* Backpressure behavior: when overloaded do we return 429/503?

### Observability / operations

* Required logs: access logs, audit logs, request/trace IDs?
* Metrics: RPS, latency, error rates, upstream timeouts, rate-limit drops?
* Tracing: OpenTelemetry? propagate `traceparent`?
* Compliance: retain logs how long? PII redaction?

### Deployment constraints

* Cloud provider / Kubernetes? Allowed components: Envoy, NGINX, Kong, custom Go?
* Managed Redis? Kafka? External auth service already exists?
* Any constraints on languages / libraries / “must use existing LB”?
