A broker is a Kafka server that stores partitions and serves read/write requests
from producers and consumers.
Yes, Kafka can run with one broker, but without fault tolerance or high availability.


Each broker manages:
* Topic partitions
* Message storage
* Replication
* Client requests

In a single-broker setup, Kafka works functionally, but if that broker goes down,
the entire cluster is unavailable.


### Key points interviewers expect
* Brokers form a Kafka cluster
* Partitions are distributed across brokers
* Replication requires multiple brokers
* Production setups always use 3+ brokers


### One-liner to remember
> A broker is a Kafka node that stores data and serves clients. One broker works,
but it’s not fault-tolerant.
