Optimizing DynamoDB performance (short & senior-level):

* Normalization + synthetic keys

  * Model tables around access patterns, not relations.
  * Use composite (synthetic) keys like `PK = USER#123`, `SK = ORDER#2026-01` to avoid
  scans and hot partitions.
  * Denormalize *only when it reduces queries*.

* Capacity modes

  * On-demand → unpredictable traffic, spiky workloads, zero capacity planning.
  * Provisioned → stable traffic, lower cost at scale; tune RCUs/WCUs.
  * Auto-scaling → provisioned + elasticity; still needs good baseline settings.

* DAX (DynamoDB Accelerator)

  * In-memory cache for read-heavy, low-latency workloads.
  * Use when reads are repetitive and milliseconds matter.
  * Not good for write-heavy or strongly consistent reads.

Rule of thumb (interview):

> *Fix data modeling first, then choose capacity mode, and add DAX only if read latency is still a problem.*
