NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) is **ERC-721**. Unlike ERC-20 tokens, which are fungible
and identical to each other, ERC-721 tokens are unique and represent individual assets.
Each ERC-721 token has its own unique identifier and cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one
basis with other ERC-721 tokens.

Another related standard is **ERC-1155**, which supports both fungible and non-fungible
tokens in a single contract. This standard is more flexible and efficient for use cases
where multiple types of tokens are needed, such as in gaming where you might have both
unique items (NFTs) and currency (fungible tokens) in the same ecosystem.
