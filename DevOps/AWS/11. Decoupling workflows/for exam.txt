Never tightly couple. Avoid answers that include tight coupling.
Loose coupling is better.
Every level of application should be loosely coupled.
There is no single way to decouple.

==================================== SQS (Simple Queue Service) ====================================
Poll-based.
SQS is pull service:
USER --> FRONTEND EC2 --> SQS <-- BACKEND EC2

SQS messaging. It's imperative that you know what all the settings do.
Messages can only live up to 14 days max.
Long polling is more efficient.
Messages are 256 KB of text in any format.

DLQs (Dead Letter Queues) are the best sideline. If the scenario laid out mentions
problems with a message in SQS, think about DLQ and visibility timeout.
Make sure you set up an alarm and alert on queue depth.
FIFO Requirements. DLQs for FIFO. SQS queues must also be FIFO.
You can create SQS DLQ for SNS topics.

Ordered messages. FIFO.
FIFO queues do not have the same performance as standard queues.
Message deduplication ID. Token used for deduplication of sent messages. Matching
deduplication IDs are not delivered during a deduplication interval.
Message Group ID. Helps ensures messages are proceeded one by one
in a strict order based on the group.
It costs more since AWS must spend compute power to deduplicate messaged.

Queues are not bi-directional. If you need communication to return to the instance
that sent the message, you will need a second queue.

If the visibility timeout on a message in an SQS queue expires,
what happens to the message?
 - Answer: It's now available in the queue to be retrieved.

==================================== SNS (Simple Notification Service) ====================================
SNS - push-based messaging service. Real time alerting. Proactive notifications = SNS.
Has different subscriber options.
Only supports custom retry policies for HTTP(S) endpoints.
FIFO topics support ordering and deduplication.
Know the fanout architectures presented.
Is often used with CloudWatch.

==================================== API Gateway ====================================
It acts as a secure front door to external communication coming into your environment.
You should favor answers that include API Gateway over those that hardcode access and
secret keys.
Any time the exam talks about creating or managing an API, think API Gateway.
API Gateway supports versioning for your API.
You can choose different API types

==================================== Batch ====================================
Perfect for long-running and event-driven workloads. Anything requiring more
than 15 minutes.
It is managed service. It leverages AWS to handle the infrastructure creations
and configurations.
Jobs: Units of work submitted to AWS Batch.
Job definitions: Blueprints within the job.
All jobs get submitted to queues.

Batch or Lambda? Lambda has several limitations. Consider runtimes, execution
time limits, and file storage sizes.

What type of compute? Use cases determine when to use Fargate or EC2 instances

Managed or Unmanaged?
 - Managed compute environments leverage AWS for managing capacity and compute.
They are the most common.
 - Unmanaged allows you to manage everything. They are used for specific scenarios.

==================================== Amazon MQ ====================================
Managed broker service for easily migrating message broker systems to
the AWS Cloud.
Allows you to leverage both Apache ActiveMQ or RabbitMQ engine types.
New applications should try and leverage SNS with SQS.
AmazonMQ restricts access to private networking. Must have VPC connectivity (e.g.
Direct Connect or Site-to-Site VPN)
Amazon MQ offers HA architectures that are dependent on the engine type

==================================== Step Functions ====================================
AWS Step Functions is serverless orchestration service meant for event-driven
task executions using AWS services. Comes with a graphical interface.

Execution types.
 - Standard workflows are good for long-running, auditable executions.
 - Express workflows are good for high-event-rate executions.

Amazon State Language. All machines are written in the Amazon State Language format.

States. States are elements within your state machines. These are things and
actions that happen with workflows.
State types: Pass, Task, Choice, Wait, Success, Fail, Parallel, MaP.

Step Functions has many integrations with another AWS services.

==================================== AppFlow ====================================
AppFlow is fully managed integration service for transferring data to and from SaaS
vendors and applications. It is bi-directional.
Usage example:
 - an application needs to reference large amount of SaaS data
regularly, and the data needs to be accessed from within S3.
 - if you need to ingest data regularly from Salesforce into Amazon S3 for
 your application to process.

Questions:
What type of firewall can be used in conjunction with API Gateway to help
prevent DDoS attacks?
 - Answer: Web Application Firewall (WAF)

Which of the following endpoints can use a custom delivery policy to define
how Amazon SNS retries the delivery of messages when server-side errors occur?
 - Answer: HTTP/S
