Monitoring Lambda = logs + metrics + tracing.

CloudWatch Logs (debugging):

* Write logs to CloudWatch automatically
* Use structured JSON logs (not plain strings) for filtering and analysis
* Include fields: request_id, correlation_id, user_id, latency_ms, error_type
* Set log retention (don’t keep forever)

CloudWatch Metrics (health + SLOs):

* Native metrics:
  - Invocations, Errors, Duration, Throttles, ConcurrentExecutions
* Add custom metrics for business KPIs:
  - processed_events_total, retries_total, external_api_latency_ms
* Use alarms:
  - error rate spike, throttles > 0, p95 duration near timeout

AWS X-Ray (distributed tracing):

* Enable tracing to see end-to-end request flow
* Useful for:
  - slow dependencies (DB, HTTP calls)
  - pinpointing where time is spent
  - finding bottlenecks across services
* Propagate trace/correlation IDs through downstream calls

Best practices:

* Emit one log line per important event (start/end/error)
* Add dashboards (errors, p95 latency, throttles, concurrency)
* Use DLQ metrics and alarms if async sources
* Sample traces/logs to control cost under high load

Interview answer to “How do you monitor/debug Lambda?”

> I rely on CloudWatch for structured logs and alarms on core metrics like error rate,
p95 duration, and throttles. For deeper debugging across services, I enable X-Ray tracing
and propagate correlation IDs, so I can pinpoint slow dependencies and failures end-to-end.

👉 Think: `logs for details`, `metrics for health`, `traces for the full path`.
