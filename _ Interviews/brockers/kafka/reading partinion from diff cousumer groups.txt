👉 Different consumer groups can read the same partition and the same messages.

* Kafka tracks offsets per consumer group
* Each group has its own offsets
* So multiple consumer groups can independently read all messages from the
 same partition

Important contrast:
* Within one consumer group: one partition → only one consumer
* Across different consumer groups: the same partition → many consumers

Interview takeaway:
> Kafka allows message fan-out by letting multiple consumer groups independently
consume the same partitions.
