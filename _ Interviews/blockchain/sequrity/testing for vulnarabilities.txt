To test smart contracts for vulnerabilities, use the following methods:

### 1. **Manual Code Review**
   - Look for common issues like reentrancy, integer overflows, unchecked external
   calls, and access control weaknesses.

### 2. **Automated Tools**
   - **MythX**: Detects reentrancy, overflows, etc.
   - **Slither**: Static analysis for security issues.
   - **Echidna**: Fuzz testing for random inputs.
   - **Manticore**: Symbolic execution to explore edge cases.
   - **Securify**: Checks common vulnerabilities.

### 3. **Testing Frameworks**
   - Use **Foundry**, **Hardhat**, and **Waffle** for unit tests and fuzzing.

### 4. **Bug Bounties & External Audits**
   - Platforms like **Immunefi** for bug bounties, or hire firms like
   **OpenZeppelin** or **CertiK** for audits.

### 5. **Simulated Attacks**
   - Simulate attacks using **Tenderly** or **Ganache**.

Focus on common vulnerabilities such as reentrancy, overflows, and authorization
flaws.
