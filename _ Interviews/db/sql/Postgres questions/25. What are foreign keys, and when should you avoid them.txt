Foreign keys enforce referential integrity between tables.

Why they hurt in high-load systems:

* Add extra checks on every write
* Increase lock contention
* Cascades can trigger massive operations
* Don’t scale across services or shards
* Reduce availability when referenced tables are slow

When to avoid:

* write-heavy or high-concurrency systems
* distributed / microservice architectures

One-liner:

> Foreign keys improve safety but often hurt performance and availability under high load.
