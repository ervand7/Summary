**Key Differences Between Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption**

### **Symmetric Encryption**
- **Key Usage:** Single secret key for both encryption and decryption.
- **Speed:** Fast and efficient for large data volumes.
- **Key Distribution:** Requires secure sharing of the secret key.
- **Security:** If the key is compromised, all encrypted data is at risk.
- **Common Algorithms:** AES, DES, Blowfish.

### **Asymmetric Encryption**
- **Key Usage:** Pair of keysâ€”public key for encryption and private key for decryption.
- **Speed:** Slower due to complex computations.
- **Key Distribution:** Public keys can be openly shared; private keys remain confidential.
- **Security:** More secure for key exchange; private key never transmitted.
- **Common Algorithms:** RSA, ECC, DSA.

### **Summary**
- **Symmetric:** Best for speed and encrypting large data when secure key exchange is possible.
- **Asymmetric:** Ideal for secure key distribution, digital signatures, and authentication.

**In Blockchain:**
- **Asymmetric Encryption** is primarily used for digital signatures and address generation.
- **Symmetric Encryption** is rarely used directly but may be employed for encrypting
off-chain data.
