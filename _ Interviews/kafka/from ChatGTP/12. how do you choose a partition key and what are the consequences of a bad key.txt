A partition key should group related messages that require ordering and be
well-distributed to avoid hot partitions.
A bad key causes skewed load, poor scalability, and consumer lag.


Kafka hashes the key to choose a partition.
Messages with the same key always go to the same partition, preserving order.
If the key has low cardinality or is unevenly distributed, some partitions become
overloaded while others stay idle.


### Key points interviewers expect
* Key defines ordering scope
* Same key → same partition
* Good key:
  * High cardinality
  * Even distribution
  * Matches business logic (user_id, order_id, account_id)
* Bad key:
  * Null key → round-robin (no ordering)
  * Constant key → single hot partition


### Real consequences of a bad key
* One partition becomes a bottleneck
* Consumer lag grows
* Rebalancing doesn’t help
* Throughput plateaus despite more consumers


### One-liner to remember
> Partition keys define both ordering and scalability — choose them carefully.
