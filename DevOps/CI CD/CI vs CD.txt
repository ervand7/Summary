Here's the difference between Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery
(CD) in software development:

**Continuous Integration (CI):**
1. **Goal:** CI is focused on integrating code written by different developers into a
common code repository. The primary goal of CI is to detect conflicts and errors as
early as possible in the development process.

2. **Frequency:** The CI process is executed with every commit to the code repository.
This can happen tens or hundreds of times a day.

3. **Testing:** Automated code testing is an integral part of CI to ensure code quality.
This includes unit testing, integration testing, and more.

4. **Integration:** Code is integrated into the shared repository after each commit.
Errors and conflicts can be identified at an early stage.

**Continuous Delivery (CD) and Continuous Deployment (CD):**

1. **Goal:** CD aims to deliver software that is ready for release to end users.
Continuous Delivery means the software is always ready for release, but the decision
to release is made by a human. Continuous Deployment, on the other hand, involves
automatic release after successful checks.

2. **Frequency:** CD processes occur after passing CI and typically involve automated
testing and deployment to testing and/or production servers.

3. **Testing:** CD includes thorough testing on various environments to ensure the
software works as expected.

4. **Release:** Continuous Delivery prepares the software for release, but the decision
to release is usually made by a human. Continuous Deployment involves automated release
without human intervention.

**In summary, the main difference between CI and CD is that CI is focused on code
integration and error detection, while CD is focused on delivering software ready
for release. Both processes play crucial roles in software development and can be
used together to streamline and improve the development process.**
