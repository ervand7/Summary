* EXPLAIN
  * Shows the planned execution strategy
  * No query execution
  * Estimated costs only

* EXPLAIN ANALYZE
  * Executes the query
  * Shows actual timings, rows, and loops
  * Reveals mismatches between estimates and reality

Why ANALYZE matters:

> Plans can be wrong; `ANALYZE` shows what really happened.

One-liner (interview-ready):

> EXPLAIN shows the plan, EXPLAIN ANALYZE runs the query and shows real performance.
