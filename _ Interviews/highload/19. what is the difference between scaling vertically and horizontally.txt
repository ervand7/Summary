👉 The difference is how you increase system capacity.

Vertical scaling (scale up):
* Add more resources to a single machine
* More CPU, RAM, faster disk
* Simple to implement
* Has hard physical limits

Horizontal scaling (scale out):
* Add more machines or service instances
* Load is distributed across instances
* Requires stateless services and load balancing
* More complex, but far more scalable

Key differences:
* Vertical scaling improves one instance
* Horizontal scaling increases parallelism
* Vertical scaling has a ceiling
* Horizontal scaling enables fault tolerance

In Go services:
* Vertical scaling helps CPU-bound handlers
* Horizontal scaling is preferred for high RPS
* Stateless Go services scale horizontally very well

Key insight:
* High-load systems rely on horizontal scaling
* Vertical scaling is usually a temporary solution

One-line interview answer:
> Vertical scaling adds more resources to a single machine, while horizontal scaling adds
more instances and distributes load, making it the preferred approach for high-RPS,
fault-tolerant systems.
