In the context of **EIP-4337**, a **User Operation** is a new concept that
replaces traditional Ethereum transactions for account abstraction. Instead of
sending a transaction directly to the Ethereum network like in the current model, a
**User Operation** is a request that is sent to a special mempool (separate from the
Ethereum transaction mempool) where it can be picked up by "bundlers" and executed.

### Key Concepts of User Operation:
1. **User Operation Object**: It is essentially a structured data object that contains
information about the action a user wants to perform. This can be thought of as a
"transaction" but with more flexibility.

2. **Mempool for User Operations**: Unlike the traditional mempool where regular Ethereum
transactions are broadcasted, **User Operations** are sent to a different mempool
specifically for account abstraction. This mempool holds these operations until they are
processed by a **bundler**.

3. **Bundlers**: These are special actors in the EIP-4337 system that take multiple **User
Operations** from the mempool, bundle them together, and submit them to Ethereum as a
single transaction. This makes the system more efficient and enables batching of multiple
actions.

4. **Validation**: Instead of the traditional method where only EOAs can sign and send
transactions, **User Operations** allow smart contracts to define custom validation logic.
This means the account can verify transactions in different ways (multisig, social
recovery, etc.) before they are bundled and sent to the network.

### Example of How User Operations Work:
Letâ€™s say you have an account that uses a custom multisig verification method. When you
want to send a transaction:
1. You submit a **User Operation** to the dedicated mempool, describing what action you
want to take (e.g., send 1 ETH to another account).
2. A **bundler** collects this **User Operation**, bundles it with others, and sends it
as a single Ethereum transaction.
3. The network executes the bundled transaction, and your operation is validated according
to your custom multisig logic.

### Why is User Operation Important?
It decouples the **transaction validation** from the traditional EOA model, allowing
accounts to define custom rules for validating actions. For example, you can have:
- Gas payments in tokens other than ETH.
- Transactions validated by multiple signatures.
- Wallet recovery mechanisms through social recovery.

In essence, **User Operations** bring more flexibility to how accounts work, allowing
features that are not possible in the traditional Ethereum model without smart contracts.
