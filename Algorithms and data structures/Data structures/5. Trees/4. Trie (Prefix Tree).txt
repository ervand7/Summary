A Trie, also known as a Prefix Tree, is a tree-like data structure that is used
for efficient retrieval of a key in a dataset of strings. Unlike binary search
trees, where each node has links to two children, each node in a Trie has links
to multiple children corresponding to the characters of the alphabet.

The key benefit of a Trie is its ability to provide fast and efficient string
search operations. It achieves this by organizing the keys in a tree structure,
where each level of the tree represents a character in the key. The nodes along
the path from the root to a particular node represent the characters in the key
up to that point.

Here are some key characteristics of Tries:

1. **Root:** The topmost node in the Trie, representing an empty string.

2. **Node Structure:** Each node in a Trie typically contains a set of pointers
(or links) to its children, along with an indicator of whether the node represents
the end of a key.

3. **Edges:** The edges in a Trie represent the characters in the keys. Each edge
leads to a child node, and the concatenation of characters along the path from
the root to a node represents a key.

4. **Children:** Each node may have multiple children, each corresponding to a
different character.

5. **Path to Node:** The path from the root to a node represents a key in the Trie.

Tries are commonly used in applications that involve storing and searching for
strings, such as spell checkers, IP routers, and autocomplete systems. They
excel in scenarios where there is a large dataset of strings, and efficient
lookup or retrieval is crucial.

Let's consider a Trie that stores the following words: "bat," "batman," "bats,"
"batwoman."

```
Root
|-- 'b'
    |-- 'a'
        |-- 't'
            |-- 's' (end of word)
            |-- 'm'
                |-- 'a'
                    |-- 'n' (end of word)
            |-- 'w'
                |-- 'o'
                    |-- 'm'
                        |-- 'a'
                            |-- 'n' (end of word)
```

In this Trie:

- The characters 'b,' 'a,' 't,' 's,' 'm,' 'w,' and 'o' are represented by the edges.
- Each node contains a set of pointers to its children.
- The presence of "end of word" indicators ('s,' 'n,' 'n') denotes the completion
of a word along the path from the root to that node.

This structure allows for efficient searches, insertions, and deletions of words
in the Trie. Keep in mind that the Trie structure can vary based on the specific
implementation and the order of characters in the keys.
