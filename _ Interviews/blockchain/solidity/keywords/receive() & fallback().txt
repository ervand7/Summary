In Solidity, the `receive()` and `fallback()` functions are special functions that
handle how a contract behaves when it receives Ether without specific instructions or
when it is called with data that doesn’t match any function signature in the contract.
These functions allow contracts to manage unexpected or direct Ether transfers and
handle undefined function calls. Here’s why and when you should use them:

### 1. **`receive()` Function:**
The `receive()` function is a special function that is triggered when a contract receives
Ether without any data (i.e., when someone sends Ether directly to the contract's address
without calling a specific function).

#### Example:
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MyContract {
    uint public receivedEther;

    // The receive function is triggered on plain Ether transfers
    receive() external payable {
        receivedEther += msg.value;
    }
}
```

### 2. **`fallback()` Function:**
The `fallback()` function is a more general-purpose function that gets triggered in
the following situations:
- When a contract receives Ether, but there is no `receive()` function defined, and the
data is empty.
- When a contract is called with data that doesn’t match any existing function signature.

#### Example:
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MyFallbackContract {
    uint public receivedEther;
    string public lastFunctionCalled;

    // Fallback function that handles calls to non-existent functions
    fallback() external payable {
        receivedEther += msg.value;
        lastFunctionCalled = "Fallback called";
    }
}
```

### Key Differences and Use Cases:
- **`receive()` vs. `fallback()`**:
  - **`receive()`** is only used for receiving Ether transfers without data.
  - **`fallback()`** is a catch-all function that handles all calls to the contract that
  don’t match any existing function signature. It can also receive Ether if `msg.data`
  is not empty or if the contract doesn’t have a `receive()` function.

- **When to Use `receive()`**:
  - Use `receive()` when your contract should only process direct Ether transfers without
  data and you don’t need to handle other kinds of unmatched function calls.

- **When to Use `fallback()`**:
  - Use `fallback()` if you need to handle function calls that don’t match any existing
  function signatures or if you need a catch-all for unexpected Ether transfers with data.

### Summary:
- **`receive()`**: Simpler and only used for receiving Ether without data.
- **`fallback()`**: More versatile, can handle both Ether transfers with data and calls
to non-existent functions.

By using `receive()` and `fallback()` functions, your Solidity contract can be more
resilient and handle unexpected or direct Ether transfers, as well as undefined
function calls, in a controlled and predictable manner.
