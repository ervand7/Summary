MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control) means PostgreSQL keeps multiple versions
of rows so that reads don’t block writes and writes don’t block reads.

Why it’s important:
* Readers see a consistent snapshot
* Writers don’t lock readers
* High concurrency without blocking

In practice:
* `UPDATE` creates a new row version
* Old versions stay until cleaned by VACUUM

One-liner (interview-ready):
> MVCC allows PostgreSQL to handle many concurrent transactions safely without read/write
blocking.
