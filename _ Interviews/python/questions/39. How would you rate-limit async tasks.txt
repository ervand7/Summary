Rate limiting controls how many tasks run concurrently.

Common approaches:
* asyncio.Semaphore → limit concurrent tasks
* Token bucket / leaky bucket
* Queue + worker pool
* External rate limiter (Redis)

Example idea:
> Acquire permit → run task → release permit

Key takeaway:
> Limit concurrency to protect resources
