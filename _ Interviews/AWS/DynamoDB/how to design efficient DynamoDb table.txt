Design DynamoDB tables around access patterns.

* Start with queries, not entities
* Choose Partition Key for even data distribution
* Use Sort Key to support range queries and ordering
* Add GSIs only for required additional access patterns
* Avoid scans; use Query + indexes
* Use conditional writes for idempotency and consistency
* Use TTL for automatic cleanup

Primary rule: key design = performance + scalability.
