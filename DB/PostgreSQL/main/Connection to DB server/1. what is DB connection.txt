In the context of databases, including PostgreSQL, a "database connection" refers
to the establishment of a communication channel between a database server and a
client application. When a client application needs to interact with a
database—such as retrieving data, inserting records, or performing other
database operations—it establishes a connection to the database server.

Here are some key points about database connections in the context of PostgreSQL:

1. **Connection Establishment:** To perform any operations on a PostgreSQL
database, a client application must establish a connection to the PostgreSQL
server. This is typically done by providing connection parameters such as the
server address, port number, database name, username, and password.

2. **Connection Pooling:** Database connections are often a limited and valuable
resource. Connection pooling is a technique used to efficiently manage and reuse
a pool of database connections. Instead of opening a new connection for each client
request, a connection from the pool is reused, improving performance.

3. **Connection Lifecycle:** A database connection has a lifecycle that includes
establishing a connection, executing SQL statements, and then closing the connection
when it's no longer needed. It's important to manage connections carefully to avoid
issues such as connection leaks, where a connection is not properly closed after use.

4. **Concurrency:** In a multi-user environment, multiple client applications may
establish concurrent connections to the same PostgreSQL database. The database server
needs to manage these concurrent connections to ensure data consistency and integrity.

5. **Connection Limit:** PostgreSQL has a configurable limit on the number of
concurrent connections it can handle. This limit is set in the PostgreSQL server
configuration (`max_connections`). If the limit is reached, new connection attempts
may be rejected.

In summary, a database connection in the context of PostgreSQL is a communication
link between a client application and the database server, allowing the client to
perform various operations on the database. Managing connections efficiently is
crucial for optimizing performance and resource utilization.
