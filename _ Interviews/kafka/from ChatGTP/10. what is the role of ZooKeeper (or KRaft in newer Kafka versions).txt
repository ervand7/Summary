ZooKeeper (legacy) and KRaft (modern) are used for Kafka cluster metadata
management and controller coordination. KRaft replaces ZooKeeper and removes
Kafka’s external dependency.


ZooKeeper was responsible for:
* Broker registration
* Controller election
* Topic and partition metadata
* Leader election

KRaft (Kafka Raft) moves this logic inside Kafka itself, using the Raft
consensus protocol for metadata replication.


### Key points interviewers expect
* ZooKeeper is deprecated in modern Kafka
* KRaft = built-in consensus & metadata layer
* Removes operational complexity
* Improves scalability and reliability


### One-liner to remember
> ZooKeeper managed Kafka metadata; KRaft does the same internally using Raft.
