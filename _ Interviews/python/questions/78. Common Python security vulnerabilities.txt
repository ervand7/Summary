Common Python security vulnerabilities:

* SQL injection (unsafe query building)
* Command injection (os.system, subprocess)
* Insecure deserialization (pickle)
* Hardcoded secrets
* Path traversal in file access
* Improper input validation
* Insecure dependency versions

Key idea:
> Never trust input, always validate and sanitize
