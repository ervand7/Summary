Escape analysis is the process that the compiler uses to determine the
placement of values that are created by your program. Specifically, the compiler
performs static code analysis to determine if a value can be placed on the stack
frame for the function constructing it, or if the value must "escape" to the
heap. In Go, there is no keyword or function you can use to direct the compiler
in this decision. Itâ€™s only through the convention of how you write your code
that you can impact this decision.
