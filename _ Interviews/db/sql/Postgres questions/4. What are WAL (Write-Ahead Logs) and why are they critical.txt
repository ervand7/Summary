WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) is a mechanism where PostgreSQL writes changes to
a log first, before applying them to data files.

Why it’s critical:

* Crash recovery – DB can replay WAL after a crash
* Durability (ACID) – committed data is not lost
* Replication – replicas stream WAL from primary
* Point-in-time recovery (PITR)

One-liner (interview-ready):
> WAL guarantees durability and recovery by logging changes before they hit disk.
