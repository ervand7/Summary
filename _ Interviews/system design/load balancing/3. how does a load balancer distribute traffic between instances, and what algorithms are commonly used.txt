👉 A load balancer distributes traffic by selecting a backend instance for each
request or connection using a routing algorithm.

### Common algorithms

Round robin
* Requests go to instances in order
* Simple, fair for identical instances

Weighted round robin
* More traffic to stronger instances
* Useful with different instance sizes

Least connections
* Sends traffic to the least busy instance
* Good for long or uneven requests

Hash-based routing
* Same key → same instance
* Useful for cache locality or affinity

Consistent hashing
* Minimizes remapping when instances change
* Used in large-scale caching systems

### Key insight (interview gold)

> Even traffic distribution does not mean even load — slow requests and DB limits
> still cause bottlenecks.

### One-liner answer

> Load balancers route traffic using algorithms like round-robin, least-connections,
or hashing to balance load, latency, and affinity.
