**Description:**
Front-running involves an attacker observing pending transactions and submitting their own
transactions with higher gas fees to get prioritized by miners. MEV refers to the maximum
value miners can extract by reordering, including, or excluding transactions within a block.

**Example:**
An attacker sees a pending transaction to buy a token and quickly submits a buy order with a
higher gas fee to purchase before the original transaction, potentially manipulating the
tokenâ€™s price.

**Mitigation:**
- **Commit-Reveal Schemes:** Conceal critical information until all commitments are made.
- **Batch Auctions:** Aggregate transactions to minimize individual transaction influence.
- **Use of Private Transactions:** Platforms like Flashbots can help reduce MEV by enabling
private transaction submission.
