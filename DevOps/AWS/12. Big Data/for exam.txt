==================================== RedShift ====================================
On the exam always favor large batches.
You should not use RedShift in place of RDS.
Redshift is a relational database based on PostgreSQL.
Supports a lot of data uo to 16 PB.
You can deploy a Multi-AZ cluster for high availability.
Use RedShift Spectrum to efficiently and quickly process data in S3.
Leverage Snapshots for point-in-time recovery, or restoration to other regions.

============================== EMR ===========================
EMR - big data platform that allows you to process vast amount of data.
Extract, transform, and load (ETL) jobs.

EC2 Purchasing rules apply. Remember, you can leverage On-Demand, Reserved
and Spot instances.

Tools to keep in mind. Built-in support for Spark, Hive, HBase, Flink,
Hudi and Presto

Storage type Indicators. Keyword indicators can include Hadoop Distributed
File System (HDFS) and EMR File System (EMRFS).

Use Cases and Scenarios: Large dataset processing (ETL), web indexing,
machine learning and large-scale genomics.

================================== Kinesis ===============================
Kinesis offers real-time processing.
Kinesis vs SQS. Both are message brokers, but only Kinesis is real time.
Kinesis Data Analytics - for transforming data.

Scaling. Data Streams does not automatically scale. Data Firehouse does.

SQS and Kinesis can both be queues.

Amazon Managed Service for Apache Flink (formerly Kinesis Data Analytics) allows
you to query Kinesis data streams and perform interactive data analytics.

=============================== Kinesis Data Streams ============================
Use case:
Kinesis Data Streams can be used to continuously collect data about player-game
interactions and feed the data into your gaming platform.

=============================== Kinesis Data Firehose ============================
Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is a fully managed service that automatically captures,
transforms, and loads streaming data into data lakes, data stores, and analytics
services. It supports direct integration with Amazon S3 and Amazon Elasticsearch
Service (now called Amazon OpenSearch Service).

================================== Athena and Glue ===============================
Athena - SQL serverless solution. Allows you to directly query your data
that's stored in S3.

Athena and Glue. Knowing the 3000-foot view of these services is good
enough for this exam.
When Athena can work by itself, Glue can design a schema for your data

================================== QuickSight ===============================
QuickSight - data visualization service (creating a dashboards).
If you see "Business intelligence" - think about QuickSight.
Integrates with many AWS services.
Per-session and per-user pricing.
Enterprise edition allows for more advanced capabilities.
SPICE is a powerful in-memory engine.

================================== DataPipeline ===============================
 - Managed ETL. Managed AWS service for ETL workflows that automates movements
and transformations of your data.
 - Data driven. Use data-driven workflows to create dependencies between tasks
and activities.
 - Storage integrations. There are several integrations, including DynamoDB,
RDS, Redshift and S3
 - Compute integrations. Easily integrate it with EC2 and EMR for managed
compute needs.
 - Amazon SNS. Leverage SNS for any notifications

================================== Apache Kafka (MSK) ===============================
 - Fully managed AWS service for running and building Apache Kafka data
streaming applications.
 - Service handles control-plane operations: creation, updating and deletion
of clusters
 - Data Plane. Leverage the same Apache Kafka data-plane operations for
 producing and consuming data.
 - Automation mitigation most of the common failures
 - Encryption. Integrates with KMS and uses TLS 1.2 for in-transit communications
 - Logging. Push broker logs to cloudWatch, S3 or Kinesis data Firehose. API
 calls are logged to CloudTrail

================================== OpenSearch ===============================
OpenSearch offers a fully managed way of running search and analytics engines.
If you are given a scenario on the exam that talks about creating a logging
solution involving visualisation of log file analytics or BI reports, there's
a good chance OpenSearch will be included.

It is used as a manager analytics and visualisation service.
AWS may still reference its predecessor Elasticsearch. The same concepts apply.
