1) Regions.
Region is a physical location. AWS logically groups its Regions
into geographic locations. A Region is a collection of AZs. You should
set up resources in Regions closest to your users.
A Region is global and has 2 or more AZs. Regions are geographically isolated
locations around the globe.

2) Availability Zones.
Availability Zones (AZs) consist of one or more physically separated data centers,
each with redundant power, networking, and connectivity, housed in separate
facilities. An AZ is associated with a single Region.
Multi-AZ deployments provide high availability. Systems that are highly
available are dependable enough to operate continuously without failure.
An AZ has multiple data centers. You can think of an AZ as a collection
of data centers.

3) Edge Locations.
Edge locations cache content for fast delivery to your users.
Edge locations ensure low latency by placing content closer to users.
There are more edge locations than Regions and AZs.
