Consumer rebalancing is the process of redistributing partitions among consumers
in a consumer group. It happens when the group membership or partition count changes.

During a rebalance, Kafka pauses consumption, revokes partitions from some consumers,
and assigns them to others so that each partition is owned by exactly one consumer
in the group.

### When rebalancing happens
* A consumer joins the group
* A consumer leaves or crashes
* A consumer times out (misses heartbeats)
* Topic partitions are added or removed

### Key points interviewers expect
* Rebalancing causes a temporary stop in consumption
* Poorly tuned timeouts → frequent rebalances
* Long message processing can trigger rebalances
* Proper offset commits are critical

### One-liner to remember
> Rebalancing keeps partitions evenly assigned, but it briefly stops consumers.
