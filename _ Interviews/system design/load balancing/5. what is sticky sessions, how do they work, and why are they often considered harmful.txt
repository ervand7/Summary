👉 Sticky sessions (session affinity) mean that all requests from a client are
consistently routed to the same backend instance.


### How they work
* First request is routed to an instance
* Load balancer remembers this mapping using:
  * Cookies
  * Client IP hashing
* All next requests go to the same instance

```
Client → LB → Service A (always)
```


### Why they’re often harmful
* Break load balancing — traffic becomes uneven
* Reduce fault tolerance — instance crash = lost session
* Prevent effective scaling — new instances get little traffic
* Encourage stateful services — hidden technical debt


### When they’re acceptable
* WebSockets
* Legacy systems
* Short-lived sessions with controlled load


### One-liner interview answer
> Sticky sessions bind a client to one instance, simplifying state management but
hurting scalability, resilience, and true load balancing.
