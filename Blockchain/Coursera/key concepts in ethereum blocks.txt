### Key Concepts in Ethereum Blocks:
1. **Ethereum Block Structure**:
   - **Block Header**: This is like the summary or "cover page" of a block. It includes
   important information such as the previous block's hash, the current block's hash,
   and hashes of various important components.
   - **Transactions**: Each block contains a list of transactions, which are actions
   like transferring Ether or executing a smart contract.
   - **State Root**: Represents the state of all accounts in the Ethereum network after
   all transactions in the block have been processed. Itâ€™s a hash that summarizes
   the entire state of the blockchain at that point.

2. **Hashing**:
   - **SHA-3 (Keccak)**: Ethereum uses a variant of the SHA-3 hashing algorithm
   called Keccak to generate these hashes.

3. **Merkle Tree**:
   - A Merkle Tree is a structure that organizes and hashes the transactions in a
   block in a way that makes it easy to verify if a transaction is part of the block
   without needing to check every single transaction.
   - **State Root Hash**: This is a hash that represents the state of the blockchain
   (balances, smart contract data, etc.) after all transactions in the block have been
   applied.
   - **Receipt Root Hash**: This is a hash representing all the transaction receipts,
   which include information about what happened in each transaction (like whether it
   succeeded or failed).

4. **Block Hash**:
   - The **Block Hash** is a unique identifier for each block and is calculated by
   hashing together all the important components of the block header, including the
   transaction root, state root, and receipt root.
   - The block hash serves two purposes:
     1. **Verification**: It ensures that the contents of the block haven't been
     tampered with.
     2. **Chain Linking**: It links blocks together by including the previous block's
     hash in the current block, forming a chain.

5. **Immutability**:
   - Once a block is added to the blockchain, it cannot be changed without altering
   all subsequent blocks. If someone tries to change a block, the hash of that block
   would change, causing a mismatch and making the chain invalid. This is how the
   blockchain maintains its immutability.
