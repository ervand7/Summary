In an operating system, `fork()` is a system call used to create a new process by
duplicating the calling (parent) process. The new process (child) gets a unique process
ID (PID) but initially shares the same code and memory as the parent. This is commonly
used in UNIX-like systems for multitasking, allowing processes to run independently
or in parallel.
