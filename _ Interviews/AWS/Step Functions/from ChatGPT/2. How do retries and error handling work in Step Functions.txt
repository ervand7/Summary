Step Functions handle retries and errors at the workflow level, not inside code.

* You define retries per state (`Retry`) with max attempts and backoff
* You define error handling paths (`Catch`) based on error types
* If retries fail, execution moves to a fallback or failure state
* Lambdas must be idempotent because retries are automatic

> Retries and failures are managed declaratively in the state machine, not imperatively
in Lambda code.
