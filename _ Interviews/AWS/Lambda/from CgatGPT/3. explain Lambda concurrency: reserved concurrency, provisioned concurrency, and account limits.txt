Lambda concurrency = how many Lambdas run at the same time.

* Account limit → global max for all Lambdas
* Reserved concurrency → guaranteed + capped share for one function
* Provisioned concurrency → pre-warmed instances (no cold starts, paid even if idle)

One-liner:

> Account sets the ceiling, reserved slices capacity, provisioned keeps Lambdas warm.
