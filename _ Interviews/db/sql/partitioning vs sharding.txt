## Prefer PARTITIONING when

👉 One Postgres instance, data is logically split.

* Table is very large
* Queries usually filter by date / region / tenant
* You want:

  * partition pruning
  * faster deletes (`DROP PARTITION`)
  * easier maintenance (`VACUUM`, `INDEX`)
* Strong consistency needed
* Joins across partitions required

Example:
`orders` partitioned by `created_at` (monthly)

---

## Prefer SHARDING when

👉 One DB is not enough.

* Data volume or traffic exceeds a single Postgres
* Need horizontal scaling
* Write throughput is the bottleneck
* Can tolerate:

  * cross-shard complexity
  * app-level routing
  * eventual consistency (sometimes)

Example:
`orders` sharded by `user_id` across multiple DBs

## One-line rule (interview gold)

> Partitioning = scale *inside* one database.
> Sharding = scale *beyond* one database.

---

## Common real-world path

1. Start with partitioning
2. When you hit limits → shard
