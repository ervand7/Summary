In computer science and related fields, the terms "translation" and "interpretation" are used in a somewhat different context compared to their linguistic counterparts:

**Translation** in Computer Science:
1. **Compilation**: Translation often refers to the process of converting high-level programming code,
such as source code written in languages like C, C++, or Java, into a lower-level representation,
typically machine code or bytecode. This process is known as compilation.

2. **Intermediate Code**: Some compilers generate an intermediate representation or intermediate
code, which is not machine-specific. This intermediate code can then be further translated or
interpreted for execution on different platforms.

3. **Performance**: Compiled code generally tends to be more efficient in terms of execution speed
because it has already undergone optimizations during the compilation phase. Compiled languages are
translated into machine code before execution.


**Interpretation** in Computer Science:
1. **Execution on-the-fly**: Interpretation refers to the process of directly executing a program
written in a high-level language without a prior compilation step. An interpreter reads the source
code and executes it line by line or statement by statement.

2. **Flexibility**: Interpreted languages are often more flexible and platform-independent because
they are not tied to a specific machine code. They can be executed on different platforms without
modification.

3. **Performance Overheads**: Interpreted code tends to have a performance overhead compared to
compiled code because the interpreter must read and execute each line or statement in real-time,
without the optimizations applied during compilation.

In summary, in computer science:

- **Translation** is associated with compilation, where high-level code is transformed into machine
code or an intermediate representation for execution.
- **Interpretation** involves the direct execution of high-level code by an interpreter without prior
compilation.

Both approaches have their advantages and trade-offs, and the choice between them depends on factors
like performance requirements, platform independence, and development convenience.
