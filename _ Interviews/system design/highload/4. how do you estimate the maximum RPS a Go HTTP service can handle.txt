## How do you estimate the maximum RPS a Go HTTP service can handle?

👉 There is no fixed number — max RPS depends on request cost and system limits.

Step 1: Define the request profile
* What does one request do? (CPU, DB, cache, external calls)
* Average and p99 latency
* Allocation and memory behavior

Step 2: Use Little’s Law
* Concurrency ≈ RPS × latency
* Check if memory, goroutines, and pools can handle that concurrency

Step 3: Identify hard limits
* CPU cores (CPU-bound handlers)
* DB / Redis connection pool sizes
* HTTP client and server limits
* OS limits (FDs, ports)

Step 4: Load test
* Increase RPS gradually
* Watch latency percentiles, error rate, GC, memory
* Max RPS is where latency spikes or errors start

Key insight:
* Max RPS is reached when latency or errors grow non-linearly, not when CPU hits 100%

One-line interview answer:
> I estimate max RPS by defining request cost, applying RPS × latency to understand
concurrency, identifying pool and CPU limits, and validating with load testing until
latency or error rates degrade.
