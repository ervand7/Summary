MEV, or **Maximal Extractable Value** (formerly known as Miner Extractable Value),
refers to the profit that validators (previously miners in a Proof of Work system) or
others can make by reordering, including, or excluding transactions within a block they
are validating.

### Here’s how it works in simple terms:

1. **Reordering Transactions:**
   - Validators can change the order of transactions in a block to their advantage. For
   example, they might place their own transaction ahead of others to benefit from price
   changes in a decentralized exchange.

2. **Including Specific Transactions:**
   - Validators can include certain transactions that are particularly profitable. For
   instance, if they see a profitable arbitrage opportunity, they might include their own
   transaction that takes advantage of this before others.

3. **Excluding Transactions:**
   - They can also choose to leave out certain transactions that might hurt their profits
   or allow others to profit in a way they don’t want.

### Example:
Imagine there’s an opportunity to buy a token cheaply on one exchange and sell it for
more on another (arbitrage). A validator might see someone else’s transaction trying to do
this, reorder the block to put their own transaction first, and take the profit for
themselves. This manipulation is an example of MEV.

### Why is it important?
MEV can lead to unfair practices and inefficiencies in the blockchain. It can result in
higher fees and worse outcomes for regular users, as those with the power to reorder
transactions take advantage of the system for profit.

Efforts are being made to reduce the negative impacts of MEV, such as through MEV-aware
strategies and solutions like Flashbots https://docs.flashbots.net/new-to-mev
which aim to make the extraction of MEV more transparent and fair.
