👉 When you scale from 3 to 30 instances, per-instance caches become fragmented and
inefficient, while shared caches scale much better.


### What happens with per-instance (local) caches
* Each instance has its own cache
* Same data is cached 30 times
* Cache hit rate drops due to random routing
* Memory usage multiplies
* Cold starts increase after scaling

```
30 instances × same cached data
→ wasted memory
→ more DB hits
```


### What happens with shared caches (Redis / Memcached)
* One logical cache for all instances
* Cache is reused across scaling
* High and stable hit rate
* Scaling instances does not duplicate cached data


### Load balancer effect
* Random routing + local cache → poor hit rate
* Sticky sessions improve hit rate but break scalability
* Shared cache works best with stateless services


### Key insight (interview gold)
> Horizontal scaling multiplies not only compute, but also cache fragmentation and
downstream load if caching is done per instance.


### One-liner interview answer
> Scaling from 3 to 30 instances fragments local caches and increases memory and DB
load, while shared caches maintain efficiency and consistency.
