Lambda Layers are shared packages for Lambda functions.

They are used to:

* Share common libraries (e.g. Python deps)
* Share runtime code (utils, helpers)
* Reduce duplicate deployment size

Example:

* Layer contains `requests`, `boto3`, shared utils
* Multiple Lambdas reuse the same layer

Interview answer to “Have you used Lambda Layers?”

> Yes. I’ve used Lambda Layers to package shared Python dependencies and common code,
so multiple Lambda functions could reuse them without duplicating libraries
in each deployment.

👉 Think: `pip install once, reuse everywhere`.


Lambda Layers are stored in AWS Lambda and configured per function.

* You upload a layer to AWS Lambda (zip file)
* AWS stores and versions it
* You attach the layer to a Lambda function (up to 5 layers per Lambda function)


👉 Lambda loads layers at runtime before your handler runs.
