RDS - Relational Databases.
Amazon RDS automates administrative tasks, such as performing backups and patching
the software that powers your database.
Amazon RDS manages the work involved in setting up a relational database, from
provisioning the infrastructure capacity you request to installing the database
software. Once your database is up and running, Amazon RDS automates common
administrative tasks, such as performing backups and patching the software that
powers your database.


 - Amazon Aurora, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, and SQL Server.

 - RDS is for OLTP (online transactional processing) Workloads.

 - RDS is not for OLAP (online analytic processing). In this case use Redshift.

 - The longest you can store an automatic RDS backup is 35 days.
