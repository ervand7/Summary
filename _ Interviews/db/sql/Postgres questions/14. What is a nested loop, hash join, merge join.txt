PostgreSQL has three main join algorithms:

* Nested Loop Join

  * For each row in outer table, scan inner table
  * Best for small datasets or indexed lookups

* Hash Join

  * Builds hash table on smaller input
  * Fast for large, unsorted datasets
  * Requires memory

* Merge Join

  * Both inputs must be sorted
  * Efficient for large, already ordered data

Rule of thumb:

> Nested loop for small + indexed, hash join for big unsorted, merge join for sorted data.

One-liner (interview-ready):

> PostgreSQL chooses nested loop, hash, or merge joins based on data size, indexes, and ordering.
