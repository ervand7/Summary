### ðŸ§  **CAP Theorem** (in distributed systems):

A system can guarantee **only two of these three** at the same time:
1. **C â€“ Consistency**: All nodes see the same data at the same time
2. **A â€“ Availability**: Every request gets a (non-error) response
3. **P â€“ Partition Tolerance**: The system keeps working even if network fails between nodes


### ðŸ’¡ Rule:
> **You must choose 2 out of 3: CA, CP, or AP** â€” never all 3.
