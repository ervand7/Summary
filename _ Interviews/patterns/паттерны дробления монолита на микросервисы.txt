### Microservice Decomposition Patterns (Short)

1. Functional — split by business capabilities (Users, Orders, Products).
2. Data-based — split by data ownership; each service owns its data.
3. Action-based — split by operations or workflows (Create Order, Payment).
4. Event-driven — services communicate via events, reducing coupling.
5. Layer-based — split by architectural layers (API, logic, data).
6. Strangler Fig — gradually migrate from monolith to microservices.
7. Anti-Corruption Layer — isolate legacy systems with adapters.
