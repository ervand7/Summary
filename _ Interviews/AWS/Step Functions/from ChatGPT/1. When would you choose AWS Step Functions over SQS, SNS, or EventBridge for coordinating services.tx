> Use AWS Step Functions when you need explicit workflow orchestration.

Choose Step Functions when you need:

* Ordered steps (A → B → C)
* State between steps
* Built-in retries, timeouts, and error handling
* Visibility into execution
* Long-running workflows

Use SQS / SNS / EventBridge for:

* Event-driven, loosely coupled systems
* High throughput and fan-out
* Fire-and-forget processing
