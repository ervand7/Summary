* SNS → broadcast a message to all its subscribers
* SQS → store a task until someone processes it
* EventBridge → route events based on rules and event content

---

* SNS: consumers must explicitly subscribe to a topic
* SQS: consumers do NOT subscribe — they poll the queue
* EventBridge: consumers do NOT subscribe — rules match events automatically

---

### Think in real life

#### 📣 SNS = loudspeaker

> “Order created!”

* Everyone listening hears it
* Same message goes to many receivers
* No storage

#### 📦 SQS = mailbox

> “Process this order”

* Message waits until one worker picks it up
* If worker crashes → message comes back
* Reliable task execution

#### 🧠 EventBridge = smart dispatcher

> “OrderCreated, source=payments, country=DE”

* Checks rules
* Sends event only to matching targets
* No polling, no tight coupling
* Designed for domain events

### Side-by-side (short)

|                | SNS                         | SQS                   | EventBridge               |
| -------------- | ----------------------------| ----------------------| --------------------------|
| Model          | Pub/Sub                     | Queue                 | Event bus (rules-based)   |
| Delivery       | Push                        | Pull                  | Push                      |
| Consumers      | Many (same message to all)  | One per message       | Many (matched by rules)   |
| Message stored | ❌ No                       | ✅ Yes                | ❌ No                     |
| Ordering       | ❌ No                       | ✅ (FIFO)             | ❌ No                     |
| Filtering      | ❌ No                       | ❌ No                 | ✅ Yes (event pattern)    |
| Use case       | Broadcast notifications     | Background processing | Domain / app event routing|

### When to use EventBridge (important 💡)

Use EventBridge when:

* You publish **business events**, not tasks
* Producers must NOT know consumers
* You need **filtering by event fields**
* You want clean, event-driven architecture

Example:
OrderService → EventBridge →

* BillingService
* Analytics
* Email
* FraudDetection

### Interview one-liner

> SNS broadcasts messages
> SQS guarantees task processing,
> EventBridge routes domain events using rules and event content.
