* Intelligent-Tiering — automatic cost optimization when access is unpredictable
* Standard-IA — infrequent access, cheaper storage, retrieval cost
* One Zone-IA — infrequent access, single AZ, cheaper but less durable
* Glacier Instant Retrieval — archival data, fast access
* Glacier Flexible Retrieval — archival, minutes–hours retrieval
* Glacier Deep Archive — cheapest, long-term retention, hours retrieval

> Choose based on access frequency, latency needs, durability, and retention period.
