Race conditions in APIs happen when concurrent requests modify shared state.

Common causes:
* Multiple requests updating the same resource
* Missing locks or transactions
* Non-atomic read → modify → write logic
* Retries without idempotency

Examples:
* Double charging
* Lost updates
* Inconsistent balances

Key idea:
> Concurrent writes without coordination cause races
