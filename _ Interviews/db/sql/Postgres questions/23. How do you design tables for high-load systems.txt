To design tables for high-load systems, you optimize for access patterns, writes, and scale.

Key principles:

* Use simple, narrow tables (fewer columns = faster I/O)
* Choose proper primary keys (often BIGINT or UUID)
* Add indexes only for real queries
* Avoid expensive constraints on hot paths
* Prefer append-heavy patterns over frequent updates
* Design for partitioning (by time or key)
* Denormalize only when necessary


One-liner (interview-perfect):

> High-load schemas are simple, write-efficient, index-light, and designed around real
query patterns.
