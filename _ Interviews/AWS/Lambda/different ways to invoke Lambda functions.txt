AWS Lambda can be invoked in three main ways:

### 1️⃣ Synchronous (request → response)

Example:
User opens a website → clicks “Pay”

```
Browser → API Gateway → Lambda → response
```

* User waits for the result
* Lambda returns success / error immediately
* If Lambda fails → caller sees the error

👉 Like a normal HTTP request.

---

### 2️⃣ Asynchronous (fire and forget)

Example:
User uploads a photo → create thumbnails

```
S3 upload → Lambda (later)
```

* User does NOT wait
* AWS queues the event
* AWS retries automatically if Lambda fails

👉 Like sending an email: you don’t wait for the recipient to read it.

---

### 3️⃣ Polling (Lambda pulls messages)

Example:
Order processing queue

```
SQS queue ← Lambda polls → processes messages
```

* Lambda pulls messages itself
* Message stays in queue until processed
* If Lambda crashes → message is processed again

👉 Like a worker checking a task list.

### 🧠 One-line summary

| Type        | Who waits? | Who retries? | Typical use      |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| Sync    | Client     | Client       | APIs             |
| Async   | Nobody     | AWS          | Background jobs  |
| Polling | Nobody     | Queue        | Streams / queues |

If you want, I can explain this in Go terms or compare it to Kafka / RabbitMQ next.
