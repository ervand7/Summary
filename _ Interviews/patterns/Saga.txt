Saga is a pattern for managing transactions in distributed systems.
Instead of one large transaction, it splits the process into a sequence of small
local transactions. Each step has a compensating action that can undo it if a
later step fails, preserving data consistency without global locks.

Non-compensatable operations (those that cannot be rolled back, such as sending
money) should be placed as close to the end of the Saga as possible.
