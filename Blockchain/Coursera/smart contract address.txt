In Solidity and Ethereum, the address of a contract is determined by hashing
the creator’s account address (the address of the account that deploys the contract)
along with the nonce of the creator’s account. The nonce is a counter that represents
the number of transactions sent from the creator’s account. These two factors combined
determine the unique address of the newly created contract.
