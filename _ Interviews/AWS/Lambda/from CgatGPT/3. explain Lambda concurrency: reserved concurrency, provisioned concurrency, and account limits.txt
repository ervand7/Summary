Lambda concurrency = how many executions run at the same time.

Account concurrency (default limit):

* Account-wide limit (e.g. 1,000 concurrent executions per region)
* Shared by all Lambda functions in the account
* Exceeding it causes throttling

Reserved concurrency (per function):

* Hard limit for a specific Lambda function
* Guarantees capacity for this function
* Also caps it so it cannot exceed this number
* Protects critical Lambdas from being starved by others

Example:
* Account limit = 1,000
* Function A reserved = 200 → always has up to 200 available
* Remaining pool = 800 for other functions

Provisioned concurrency (warm capacity):

* Pre-initialized execution environments
* Eliminates cold starts
* You pay even when idle
* Scales instantly up to the provisioned value

Key differences:

* Reserved concurrency → capacity isolation + throttling control
* Provisioned concurrency → performance (no cold starts)
* Account limit → global ceiling

Interview answer to “Explain Lambda concurrency”

> Lambda scales by running multiple concurrent executions.
Account limits define the maximum total concurrency.
Reserved concurrency guarantees and caps capacity per function.
Provisioned concurrency keeps a fixed number of warm instances to eliminate cold starts.

👉 Think:
`Account limit = global ceiling`
`Reserved = guaranteed slice`
`Provisioned = always-warm engines`
