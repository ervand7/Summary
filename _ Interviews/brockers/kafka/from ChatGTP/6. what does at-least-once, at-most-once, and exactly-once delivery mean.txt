* At-most-once
  👉 Message is delivered 0 or 1 time (may be lost, never duplicated)

* At-least-once
  👉 Message is delivered 1 or more times (never lost, may be duplicated)

* Exactly-once
  👉 Message is delivered exactly 1 time (no loss, no duplicates)

One-liners for interviews:

* *At-most-once*: “Fast, but you can lose messages.”
* *At-least-once*: “Reliable, but you must handle duplicates.”
* *Exactly-once*: “Reliable and no duplicates, but more complex and costly.”
