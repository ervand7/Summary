Fuzz testing, or fuzzing, is a testing technique that involves providing random or
unexpected inputs to a program to find bugs, vulnerabilities, or other unexpected behavior.
In the context of Solidity smart contracts, fuzz testing is commonly used to test contract
functions with various inputs.
There are two main types of fuzz testing in Solidity: **stateless** and **stateful**.

### Stateless Fuzz Testing
**Stateless fuzz testing** involves testing individual functions of a smart contract with
random inputs without considering the state of the contract. Each test case is independent
of others, and the contract is typically reset to its initial state between each test.

- **Focus**: The focus is on testing the behavior of individual functions with different
inputs.
- **Use Cases**: This type of testing is useful for testing functions that are
deterministic and don't depend on the contract's state, such as pure or view functions.
- **Example**:
  - If you have a function that adds two numbers, stateless fuzz testing would randomly
  generate pairs of numbers and test the function to ensure it returns the correct sum each
  time.

**Tools**:
- **Foundry**: Foundry, a popular testing framework in Solidity, supports fuzz testing
by default. You can write test cases that automatically fuzz the inputs to your functions.
- **Hardhat and Truffle**: Although not inherently built for fuzz testing, you can
integrate fuzzing tools like Echidna to perform stateless fuzz testing in these environments.

### Stateful Fuzz Testing
**Stateful fuzz testing** (or stateful property testing) involves testing the entire
contract's state transitions by providing sequences of transactions (or operations) that
manipulate the contract's state.

- **Focus**: The focus is on testing how the contract behaves as its state changes
through multiple transactions. This type of testing helps uncover bugs that only manifest
after a sequence of operations, such as reentrancy attacks, incorrect state updates, or
issues that arise due to complex state interactions.
- **Use Cases**: This is particularly useful for testing contracts that maintain complex
states, such as DeFi protocols, governance systems, or any contract that involves multiple
operations affecting the state.
- **Example**:
  - Consider a decentralized exchange contract. Stateful fuzz testing would involve
  performing a series of operations like adding liquidity, swapping tokens, removing
  liquidity, etc., in random or specific sequences, and then checking if the contract's
  state remains consistent and correct.

**Tools**:
- **Echidna**: Echidna is a popular fuzz testing tool for Ethereum smart contracts. It
supports stateful fuzz testing by allowing you to specify sequences of transactions to be
tested against the contract.
- **Foundry**: Foundry also supports stateful fuzz testing. You can use its `vm.assume`
and other related functions to define stateful tests.

### Summary of Differences
- **Stateless Fuzz Testing**: Tests individual functions with random inputs, without
considering the state of the contract. It’s useful for simple functions that don’t change
or depend on the state.

- **Stateful Fuzz Testing**: Tests sequences of operations that change the contract’s
state, focusing on how the contract behaves as its state evolves. It’s useful for
contracts with complex state transitions.

Both types of fuzz testing are valuable for ensuring the robustness and security of smart
contracts, especially in critical applications like DeFi where unexpected behavior can
have severe consequences.
