## A. Scope & responsibility

1. Is this an L4 (TCP/UDP) or L7 (HTTP/gRPC) load balancer?
2. Is this internal (between services) or external (client-facing)?
3. Should it terminate TLS, or just pass it through?
4. Is this a managed service replacement (like ELB) or a custom LB?

## B. Traffic characteristics

5. What protocol: HTTP, HTTPS, gRPC, WebSocket?
6. Expected RPS / QPS?
7. Request size and response size (small JSON vs large payloads)?
8. Is traffic bursty or mostly stable?

## C. Routing & balancing logic

9. Which algorithms are required?

   * Round-robin
   * Least connections
   * Weighted
   * Hash-based
10. Do we need sticky sessions?
11. Routing only by IP, or also by path / header / host?

## D. Health & resilience

12. How should health checks work?
13. Do we need active or passive health checks?
14. What happens when *all* backends are unhealthy?
15. How fast must failures be detected?

## E. Scaling & availability

16. Should the LB itself be highly available?
17. Active-active or active-passive?
18. Do we expect multi-region traffic?

## F. Observability & control

19. What metrics are required?
20. Do we need rate limiting or circuit breaking?
21. Is there a control plane (dynamic config updates)?
