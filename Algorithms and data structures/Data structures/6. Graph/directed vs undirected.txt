Directed and undirected graphs are two fundamental types of graphs that differ
in how edges are represented between vertices.

1. **Directed Graph (Digraph):**
   - **Edges:** Edges have a direction or orientation, indicated by arrows.
   - **Connectivity:** The connection between two vertices has a specific starting
   and ending point.
   - **Representation:** Edges are often represented as ordered pairs (u, v), where
   "u" is the starting vertex, and "v" is the ending vertex.

   **Example:**
   ```
   A --> B
   |     ^
   v     |
   C --> D
   ```

2. **Undirected Graph:**
   - **Edges:** Edges do not have a direction; they simply connect two vertices.
   - **Connectivity:** The connection between two vertices is bidirectional; there is no
   distinction between the starting and ending points.
   - **Representation:** Edges are often represented as unordered pairs {u, v}.

   **Example:**
   ```
   A -- B
   |    |
   C -- D
   ```

In the directed graph example, the edge (A, B) indicates a one-way connection from
vertex A to vertex B, whereas in the undirected graph example, the edge {A, B}
represents a bidirectional connection between A and B.

In summary, the key distinction is whether the edges have a direction (directed) or
not (undirected).
