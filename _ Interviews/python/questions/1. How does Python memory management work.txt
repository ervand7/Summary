Python uses automatic memory management.

How it works:
* Objects are allocated on the heap
* Reference counting tracks how many references point to an object
* When refcount → 0, object is immediately freed
* Cyclic garbage collector cleans up reference cycles

Key point:
> Reference counting handles most cases, GC handles cycles
