---

# 🧭 How we should explore each system (recommended format)

For **each system**, we can follow a repeatable structure:

1. Clarify requirements
2. Define scale (RPS, data size)
3. High-level architecture (boxes & arrows)
4. Data model
5. Caching strategy
6. Scaling strategy
7. Failure modes
8. Go-specific considerations
