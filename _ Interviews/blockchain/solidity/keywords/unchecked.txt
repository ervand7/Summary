In Solidity, the `unchecked` keyword is used to disable overflow and underflow
checks for arithmetic operations within its block. Starting from Solidity version
0.8.0, integer arithmetic operations throw an error on overflows and underflows by
default. Wrapping code inside an `unchecked` block allows these operations to wrap
around (similar to previous versions) without throwing an error.

**Example:**

```solidity
uint8 x = 255;

unchecked {
    x += 1; // x becomes 0 without reverting
}
```

**Use Cases:**

- **Gas Optimization:** Disabling checks can save gas when you're certain overflows won't
occur or when wrapping behavior is desired.
- **Controlled Wrapping:** When implementing algorithms that rely on wrapping behavior.

**Caution:** Use `unchecked` carefully, as it can lead to unexpected results if not managed
properly.
