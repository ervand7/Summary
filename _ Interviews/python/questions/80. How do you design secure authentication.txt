Secure authentication focuses on strong identity proof + safe sessions.

Best practices:
* Use proven standards (OAuth2 / OIDC)
* Hash passwords with bcrypt/argon2 (never plain hash)
* Use HTTPS everywhere
* Use short-lived access tokens + refresh tokens
* Store sessions/tokens securely (HttpOnly, Secure cookies)
* Add MFA for sensitive actions

Key idea:
> Use standards and minimize token lifetime + exposure
