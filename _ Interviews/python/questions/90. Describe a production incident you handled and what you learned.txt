Incident:
A production service started timing out under load due to a downstream dependency
becoming slow, which caused request pile-ups and thread exhaustion.

Action:
* Identified the bottleneck using metrics and logs
* Added timeouts and retries with backoff
* Implemented a circuit breaker to fail fast
* Reduced blast radius by limiting concurrency

Result:
* Service stabilized quickly
* Downstream failures no longer cascaded
* Mean recovery time improved significantly

Lesson learned:
> Always design for failure - slow dependencies are more dangerous than dead ones
