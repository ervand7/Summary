## 1️⃣ CSRF — *Cross-Site Request Forgery*

What it is
A malicious site makes a victim’s browser send an authenticated request to
your backend.

Why it works
Browsers automatically attach cookies.

Example
User is logged in → visits evil site → backend receives valid request.

Mitigation

* `SameSite=Strict/Lax` cookies
* CSRF tokens
* Do not use cookies for APIs (prefer Authorization headers)

---

## 2️⃣ XSS — *Cross-Site Scripting*

What it is
Attacker injects JavaScript into your page.

Impact

* Steals tokens
* Acts as the user

Mitigation

* Escape output
* Content Security Policy (CSP)
* `HttpOnly` cookies

---

## 3️⃣ SQL Injection

What it is
User input becomes part of SQL logic.

Example

```sql
WHERE email = 'a' OR 1=1
```

Mitigation

* Prepared statements only
* Never build SQL with strings

---

## 4️⃣ IDOR — *Insecure Direct Object Reference*

What it is
User accesses someone else’s resource by changing an ID.

Example

```
GET /orders/123   → change to /orders/124
```

Key point
Authentication ≠ Authorization

Mitigation

* Always check ownership on backend

---

## 5️⃣ Authentication / JWT mistakes

What it is

* Token not verified properly
* Missing `exp`, `aud`, `iss` checks

Impact

* Full account takeover

Mitigation

* Verify signature
* Validate claims strictly

---

## 6️⃣ Replay attacks

What it is
Valid request is captured and resent.

Common in

* Payments
* Withdrawals

Mitigation

* Idempotency keys
* Nonces / timestamps

---

## 7️⃣ DoS (application-level)

What it is
Exhausting resources:

* CPU
* DB connections
* Goroutines

Go-specific
Unbounded goroutines = DoS

Mitigation

* Rate limiting
* Timeouts
* Worker pools

---

## 8️⃣ Race conditions (business logic)

What it is
Two requests modify the same state concurrently.

Example

* Double withdrawal
* Double order

Mitigation

* DB transactions
* Locks
* Idempotency
