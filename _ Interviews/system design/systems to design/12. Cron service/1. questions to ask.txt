## A. Scope (what exactly are we building?)

1. Is this a managed cron platform (like Cloud Scheduler) or an internal service for
our microservices?
2. Do we schedule HTTP/gRPC calls, queue jobs, container runs, or run code inside the
scheduler?
3. Is it only time-based (cron) or also one-off / delayed / recurring with fixed interval?
4. Do we need timezone support per job (e.g., “9am Europe/Belgrade”)?
5. Do we need calendar rules (holidays, business days), or plain cron syntax only?

## B. Core features (must-haves)

6. CRUD: create/update/pause/resume/delete schedules?
7. Can a schedule have multiple targets or only one?
8. Do we support payloads, headers, secrets, retries policy per job?
9. Do we need job runs history, logs, and run output storage?
10. Manual run: “run now” endpoint?

## C. Semantics (the hardest part)

11. Exactly-once required, or is at-least-once acceptable?
12. If a run is delayed (scheduler downtime), do we catch up missed runs or skip them?
13. If a run overlaps with the next tick, what is policy:

* allow concurrent runs
* forbid overlap (skip)
* queue (serialize)

14. What are the idempotency expectations of targets (do they handle duplicates)?
15. How do we define “success” (2xx only? any response? custom)?

## D. Retries, backoff, and DLQ

16. Retry policy: max attempts, exponential backoff, jitter?
17. What failures are retryable (timeouts/5xx) vs not (4xx)?
18. Do we need dead-letter queue + re-drive?
19. Per-job timeouts and circuit breaking (don’t spam a broken downstream)?

## E. Scale & performance targets

20. How many schedules total? (10k / 1M / 100M?)
21. Peak “fires per second” (e.g., at minute boundaries)? Burst handling requirement?
22. Latency requirement: how close to the scheduled time (p50/p99 “jitter”)?
23. Multi-tenant? quotas per team/org/user?

## F. Data model & consistency

24. Strong consistency needed for create/update/pause? Or eventual OK?
25. Are schedule edits effective immediately or “from next tick”?
26. Do we need versioning / optimistic concurrency control on updates?

## G. Security & compliance

27. Authn/authz: who can manage schedules? RBAC per namespace/project?
28. Where do secrets live (KMS/Vault)? Are payloads encrypted at rest?
29. Audit logs required (who changed what and when)?
30. Network controls: allowlist targets, SSRF protection, egress policies?

## H. Observability & ops

31. Required metrics: due time vs actual, success rate, retries, DLQ depth?
32. Do we need per-run trace propagation (traceparent)?
33. Admin tools: disable a noisy tenant, global pause, backfill controls?
