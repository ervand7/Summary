* Decouple with queues

  * Put SQS between producers and consumers to absorb traffic spikes.
  * Smooths bursts and protects downstream services from overload.

* Control Lambda concurrency

  * Set reserved concurrency to cap parallel executions.
  * Use account / function concurrency limits as a safety valve.

* Batch processing

  * Let one Lambda process multiple messages per invocation (SQS batch size).
  * Reduces invocation count, cold starts, and downstream pressure.

Rule of thumb (interview):

> Queues absorb spikes, concurrency limits protect systems, batching reduces cost
and pressure.

Applies directly to Amazon Web Services Lambda + SQS architectures.
