The Python `set` data type is implemented using a hash table. A hash table
is a data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to indices in
an array, providing efficient average-case time complexity for common
operations like insertion, deletion, and membership tests.

Here are some key points about Python sets and their implementation:

1. **Hash Table:**
   - Python sets are implemented using a hash table, making them suitable
   for operations that require fast lookup and membership testing.
   - The hash table is a dynamic array where each element is a "bucket" or a
   linked list of elements that have the same hash value (collisions).

2. **Hashing:**
   - Elements in the set are hashed using a hash function, and the resulting
   hash values are used to determine the index in the array where the element
   should be stored.
   - Python's built-in hash function is used to obtain hash values for most objects.

3. **Dynamic Resizing:**
   - The hash table dynamically resizes itself to maintain a balance between
   the number of elements and the number of buckets, ensuring efficient performance.

4. **Unordered Collection:**
   - Sets in Python are unordered collections of unique elements.

5. **Average-Case Time Complexity:**
   - The average-case time complexity for common set operations (addition, deletion, and membership tests) is O(1) on average. However, in the worst case, these operations can take O(n) time, where n is the number of elements in the set.

In summary, Python sets use a hash table for their implementation, providing
efficient average-case performance for various operations.
