**System calls** are interfaces provided by the operating system that allow
user-level applications to request services from the kernel (core of the OS).
They enable tasks such as file operations, memory management, process control,
and communication.

### Common Categories of System Calls:
1. **File Management**:
   - `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, `close()`
   - Used to manipulate files (e.g., opening, reading, writing, closing files).

2. **Process Control**:
   - `fork()`, `exec()`, `wait()`, `exit()`
   - For creating, running, synchronizing, and terminating processes.

3. **Memory Management**:
   - `mmap()`, `brk()`
   - Allows programs to allocate, deallocate, and manage memory.

4. **Communication**:
   - `pipe()`, `socket()`, `send()`, `recv()`
   - Used for inter-process communication and networking.

System calls bridge user applications with hardware resources through the OS kernel,
enabling secure and controlled access.
