Prevent data corruption by enforcing consistency at all layers.

Techniques:
* Use transactions
* Apply proper locking
* Enforce constraints at DB level
* Make operations idempotent
* Validate inputs
* Use checksums / versioning
* Handle retries carefully

Key idea:
> Assume failures happen and guard against partial writes
