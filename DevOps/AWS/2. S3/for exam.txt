A single object upload to S3 can only be up to 160 GB in size.

### Base Characteristics:
- **Object-Based Storage**: S3 stores data as objects within buckets.
- **Global Namespace**: While S3 operates on a regional basis, the namespace
for bucket names is global.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Supports MFA for additional security
during the deletion of S3 versions.
- **Automatic Scaling**: S3 automatically scales to meet demand without manual
intervention.

### Attributes of S3 Objects:
- **Key**: Represents the object name within a bucket, e.g., `MyPhoto.jpg`.
- **Value**: The actual data content, stored as a sequence of bytes.
- **Version ID**: Facilitates management of multiple versions of an object.
- **Metadata**: Additional data about the object stored, such
as tags or custom metadata.

### Access Control:
- **Default Privacy**: Buckets and objects are private by default. Both
need explicit configuration to be made public.
- **Object ACLs**: Individual objects can be made public using their
access control lists.
- **Bucket Policies**: These can be configured to set access permissions
for the entire bucket.

### Hosting Static Websites:
- **Static Content Only**: S3 can host websites that consist of static
content (HTML, CSS, JS, images).
- **Public Access**: The bucket must be public to serve content over the web.

### Versioning and Lifecycle:
- **Immutable Versioning**: Once enabled, versioning can only be suspended,
not disabled.
- **Lifecycle Policies**: Automate transitioning of objects to different
storage classes or archiving and deletion stages. Lifecycle rules can be
applied to both current and previous versions.

### Object Lock and Compliance:
- **WORM Model**: Object Lock enables a write-once, read-many model to prevent
deletion or modification.
    - **Governance Mode**: Allows designated users to manage objects unless
    they are specifically denied.
    - **Compliance Mode**: Ensures that objects cannot be modified or
    deleted by any users, including the root account.
- **S3 Glacier Vault Lock**: Implements and enforces compliance controls on
S3 Glacier vaults.
 Amazon Glacier — это облачный сервис, предназначенный для длительного и экономичного
 хранения данных, которые редко используются. Простыми словами, это "холодное
 хранилище" для данных, которые нужно сохранить надолго, но которые вы не
 планируете часто использовать.

### Encryption:
- **In Transit**: Utilizes SSL/TLS for secure data transfer.
- **At Rest**:
  - **Server-Side Encryption (SSE)**: Automatically encrypts objects on upload.
    - **SSE-S3**: Uses AES-256 encryption.
    - **SSE-KMS**: Integrates with AWS KMS for key management and additional
    audit trails.
    - **SSE-C**: Allows clients to manage their own encryption keys.
- **Client-Side Encryption**: Clients encrypt data locally before uploading to S3.
- **Bucket Policy for Enforcing Encryption**: Deny PUT requests that do not
include server-side encryption settings.

### Performance Optimization:
- **Prefix Management**: Prefixes are essentially folders that help organize
and manage access patterns.
- **Request Rate**: Support for up to 3500 write and 5500 read requests per
second per prefix. Use multiple prefixes to scale access further.
- **Multipart Uploads**:
Multipart upload allows you to upload a single object as a set of parts. After all
parts of your object are uploaded, Amazon S3 then presents the data as a
single object. With this feature you can create parallel uploads, pause and
resume an object upload, and begin uploads before you know the total object size.

- **Transfer Acceleration**:
Use case:
You transfer gigabytes to terabytes of data on a regular basis across continents.
You are unable to utilize all of your available bandwidth over the Internet when
uploading to Amazon S3

- **Byte-Range Fetches**: Enhances retrieval efficiency by fetching only
parts of an object.
- **KMS Limitations**: Be aware of request rate limits for KMS when using
SSE-KMS encryption.

### Replication:
- **Cross-Bucket Replication**: Allows replication of objects across
different buckets.
- **Initial Setup**: Only new objects are replicated following the setup;
existing objects must be manually handled.
- **Delete Marker Replication**: Not enabled by default and requires specific
configuration.

 - Notifications.
The Amazon S3 event notification feature enables you to receive notifications
when certain events happen in your bucket
