Lambda execution environment may be reused between invocations.

This means:

* The same container can serve multiple requests
* Code outside the handler runs only once per container lifecycle

What can be safely reused:

* Global variables (read-only or carefully mutated)
* Initialized SDK clients (e.g. boto3)
* Database connections / connection pools
* In-memory caches
* Loaded libraries and configuration

What you must NOT rely on:

* That reuse will always happen
* That in-memory state will persist
* That only one request runs at a time (with async / future features)

Interview answer to “What happens between Lambda invocations?”

> AWS may reuse the same execution environment between invocations, so
initialization code and global objects can be reused to improve performance,
but the lifecycle is not guaranteed and the function must remain stateless.

👉 Think: `reuse if possible, never depend on it`.
