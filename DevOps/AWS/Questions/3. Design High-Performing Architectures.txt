Your company is in the process of creating a multi-region disaster recovery
solution for your database, and you have been tasked to implement it. The
required RTO is 1 hour, and the RPO is 15 minutes. What steps can you take
to ensure these thresholds are met?
 - Use RDS to host your database. Create a cross-region read replica of your
 database. In the event of a failure, promote the read replica to be a standalone
 database. Send new reads and writes to this database.

Recently, you've been experiencing issues with your dynamic application that is
running on EC2 instances. These instances aren't able to keep up with the amount
of traffic being sent to them, and customers are getting timeouts. Upon further
investigation, there is no discernible traffic pattern for these surges.
The application can be easily containerized. What can you do to fix the
problem while keeping cost in mind?
 - Migrate the application to ECS. Use Fargate to run the required tasks
