Adding an index can make a query slower because:

* Planner chooses a bad index (wrong selectivity)
* Low-selectivity index → many random reads
* Extra index maintenance slows writes
* Index not covering → still hits the table
* Outdated statistics → wrong plan

Key idea:

> More indexes ≠ faster queries.

One-liner (interview-ready):

> An index can slow queries if it’s low-selectivity, misused by the planner,
or increases I/O and maintenance overhead.
