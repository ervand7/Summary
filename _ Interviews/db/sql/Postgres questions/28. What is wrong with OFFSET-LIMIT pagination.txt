`OFFSET / LIMIT` pagination is inefficient and unstable.

Problems:

* Database must scan and discard skipped rows
* Gets slower as `OFFSET` grows
* Results can shift or duplicate if data changes

Example issue:

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders ORDER BY id LIMIT 20 OFFSET 100000;
```

→ slow and inconsistent under writes

Better approach:

* Keyset (cursor-based) pagination

One-liner (interview-ready):

> OFFSET/LIMIT pagination is slow for large offsets and produces inconsistent
results under concurrent writes.
