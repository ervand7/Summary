WSGI:
* Synchronous interface
* One request per thread/process
* Designed for blocking I/O
* Used by Flask, Django (classic)

ASGI:
* Asynchronous interface
* Supports async/await
* Handles long-lived connections (WebSockets)
* Used by FastAPI, Starlette, modern Django

Key idea:
> WSGI = sync, ASGI = async + real-time
