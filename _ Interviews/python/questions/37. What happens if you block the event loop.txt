Blocking the event loop freezes async execution.

What happens:
* No other coroutines can run
* I/O waits are not processed
* Application becomes unresponsive

Causes:
* time.sleep()
* CPU-heavy work
* Blocking I/O calls

Solution:
* Use non-blocking async APIs
* Offload CPU work to threads/processes

Key rule:
> Never block the event loop
