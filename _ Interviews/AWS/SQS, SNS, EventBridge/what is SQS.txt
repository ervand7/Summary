What it is: Managed message queue for async decoupling between services
* Delivery:

  * Standard → at-least-once, unordered
  * FIFO → exactly-once processing, ordered
* Visibility timeout: when a consumer reads a message, SQS hides it from other
 consumers for a set time so only one worker processes it; must delete after success
* No push: Consumers poll (long polling recommended)
* Retention: 1 minute → 14 days (default 4 days)
* Message size: Max 256 KB (use S3 for large payloads)

One-liner:

> *SQS is a durable, pull-based queue for decoupling services with retries and DLQs
(is built-in), not a streaming system.
