AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service) is a publish–subscribe messaging service.


* Push-based fan-out (one message → many subscribers)
* Subscribers: Lambda, SQS, HTTP, email, SMS
* Decouples producers from consumers
* No message storage (not a queue)
* Retries & DLQ supported
* Common pattern: SNS → SQS → Lambda
* Python: publish via `boto3.publish`

One-liner:

> *SNS broadcasts events; SQS processes work.*
