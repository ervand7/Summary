__slots__ restricts which attributes an object can have.

How it works:
* Replaces per-instance __dict__ with a fixed set of attributes
* Saves memory
* Prevents dynamic attribute creation

When to use:
* Many instances of a small class
* Memory is critical
* Object structure is fixed

Trade-off:
* Less flexible
* No new attributes unless defined in __slots__

Key takeaway:
> __slots__ = lower memory, less flexibility
