Cold start is the initial delay when a serverless function (e.g. Lambda) runs for
the first time or after being idle, because the platform needs to create the
runtime and load the code before executing it.

* Happen on first run or after inactivity
* Increase latency (Python is affected by heavy imports)
* Are worse with **VPC**, large packages, or big init code
* Can be mitigated by:

  * minimizing global imports
  * keeping functions small
  * using **Provisioned Concurrency** for critical paths
  * using SnapStart: Lambda initializes the function once, takes a snapshot, and
  restores it on cold starts instead of re-running init code.
* Matter mainly for **latency-sensitive** workloads, not async jobs


Cold start optimization matters primarily for synchronous, user-facing Lambdas. For
async or background processing, the latency impact is usually negligible.
