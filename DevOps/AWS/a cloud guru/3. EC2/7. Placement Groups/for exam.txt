Placement groups:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html
 - Cluster.
 Low network latency, high network throughput. Can't span multiple AZ,
 whereas a spread placement group and partition placement group can.
 Reducing network latency in an application is the exact use case for a cluster
 placement group.
 AWS recommends homogenous instances within cluster placement groups.

 - Spread.
 Individual critical EC2 instances. Spread placement groups are great for applications
 that have a small number of critical instances that should placed on distinct hardware.

 - Partition.
 Multiple EC2 instances; HDFS, HBase, Cassandra


- You can't merge placement groups.
- AWS recommends homogenous instances within cluster placement groups.
- Only certain types of instances can be launched in a placement group (compute
optimized, GPU, memory optimized, storage optimized).
- You can move an existing instance into a placement group. Before you move
the instance, the instance must be in the stopped state. You can move or
remove an instance using the AWS CLI or an AWS SDK, but you can't
do in via the console yet.
