👉 Backpressure is a mechanism that prevents a system from accepting more work than it
can handle.

Why backpressure is needed:
* Go servers accept requests very fast
* Downstream systems (DB, APIs) are slower
* Without backpressure, requests pile up in memory

What backpressure does:
* Slows down or rejects incoming work
* Keeps concurrency within safe limits
* Prevents memory and goroutine explosions

Common backpressure techniques in Go:
* Bounded worker pools (fixed number of goroutines)
* Buffered channels with size limits
* Semaphores (`chan struct{}` or `x/sync/semaphore`)
* Connection pool limits (`MaxOpenConns`)
* HTTP 429 / fail-fast responses

Typical Go pattern:
* Try to acquire capacity
* If capacity is unavailable → reject or queue briefly
* Never spawn unbounded goroutines

Key insight:
* Backpressure protects the system by turning overload into controlled failure

One-line interview answer:
> Backpressure limits how much work a system accepts at once, and in Go it’s implemented using
bounded goroutines, limited channels, semaphores, and fail-fast behavior to prevent overload.
