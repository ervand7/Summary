1. Run `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`
   → find slow nodes (seq scan, bad join, misestimates)

2. Check indexes

   * missing index?
   * wrong index order?
   * need composite or covering index?

3. Reduce data

   * filter earlier
   * avoid `SELECT *`

4. Fix joins

   * correct join type
   * proper join keys

5. Update statistics

   * `ANALYZE`
   * fix skewed data

Key mindset interviewers want:

> Measure first, optimize second.

One-liner (interview-ready):

> I start with EXPLAIN ANALYZE, then fix indexes, joins, and data access patterns.
