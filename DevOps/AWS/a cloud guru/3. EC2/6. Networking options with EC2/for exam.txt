Network devices:
 - ENI.
 For basic networking. Perhaps you need a separate management network from
 your production network or a separate logging network, and you need to do
 this at a low cost. in this scenario, use multiple ENIs for each network.

 - Enhanced Networking.
 For when you need speeds between 10 Gbps and 100 Gbps. Anywhere you need reliable,
 high throughput.

 - EFA.
 For when you need to accelerate High Performance Computing (HPC) and machine
 learning applications or if you see a scenario question mentioning HPC or ML
 and asking what network adapter you want, choose EFA.
