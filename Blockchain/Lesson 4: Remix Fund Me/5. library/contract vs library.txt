In Solidity, both **contracts** and **libraries** are key constructs used for
organizing code, but they have different purposes and behaviors. Here's a detailed
comparison:

### 1. **Purpose and Usage:**
- **Contract:**
  - **Purpose**: A contract is the primary building block for Ethereum smart contracts.
  It encapsulates the state (variables) and behaviors (functions) that define the
  contract's functionality.
  - **Usage**: Contracts are deployed on the Ethereum network, where they can hold
  Ether, interact with other contracts, and manage complex logic.

- **Library:**
  - **Purpose**: A library is a collection of reusable functions that can be used
  by contracts. Libraries are designed to prevent code duplication and make common
  functionalities available across multiple contracts.
  - **Usage**: Libraries are not meant to be deployed as independent contracts.
  Instead, they are linked to contracts that use them, either at the compile-time
  (for internal functions) or by deploying a shared instance (for external functions).

### 2. **State Variables:**
- **Contract:**
  - Contracts can have state variables that store data persistently on the blockchain.
  These variables maintain their state across transactions.

- **Library:**
  - Libraries cannot have state variables. They do not have their own storage and
  cannot maintain state across calls. Libraries are stateless.

### 3. **Inheritance:**
- **Contract:**
  - Contracts can inherit from other contracts using Solidity's inheritance model.
  This allows them to extend and reuse the functionality of parent contracts.

- **Library:**
  - Libraries cannot inherit from other libraries or contracts. They are standalone
  and cannot extend or be extended by other libraries or contracts.

### 4. **Deployment and Gas Costs:**
- **Contract:**
  - Contracts are deployed on the Ethereum network and consume gas when interacting
  with other contracts or making state changes.

- **Library:**
  - Libraries can be deployed separately and linked to contracts. If a library
  function is marked as `internal`, it is inlined into the contract's bytecode
  at compile-time, which can reduce gas costs by avoiding the overhead of an
  external call. If the function is `external`, the library is deployed once and
  shared by multiple contracts, reducing deployment costs but slightly increasing
  gas costs for calls.

### 5. **Function Visibility:**
- **Contract:**
  - Contracts can have functions with any visibility (`public`, `private`,
  `internal`, `external`).

- **Library:**
  - Functions in a library can be `internal` or `public`. Public functions in
  libraries are treated as `external`, meaning they cannot modify the state of
  the calling contract unless they are marked as `internal`.

### 6. **Mutability:**
- **Contract:**
  - Contracts can have both mutable and immutable states. Functions within contracts
  can modify the contract's state.

- **Library:**
  - Libraries, being stateless, cannot have mutable state. However, they can modify
  the state of the contract calling the library if the function is `internal`.

### 7. **Example Use Cases:**
- **Contract:**
  - Deployed contracts for managing tokens (like ERC20), decentralized exchanges,
  or any application requiring persistent state on the blockchain.

- **Library:**
  - Utility libraries providing mathematical functions, string manipulation,
  or reusable validation logic. For example, OpenZeppelin's `SafeMath` library
  is widely used to prevent integer overflow.

### Summary:
- **Contracts** are full-fledged entities in the Ethereum ecosystem that manage
state, execute complex logic, and can be inherited.
- **Libraries** are stateless and designed to provide reusable code without the
overhead of inheritance or state management. They help reduce code duplication
and improve gas efficiency.

Understanding when to use a contract versus a library is crucial for optimizing
both the gas efficiency and maintainability of Solidity code.
