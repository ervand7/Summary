How DynamoDB scales automatically

* Table is split into many physical partitions
* Each partition has fixed limits (storage + read/write capacity)
* DynamoDB monitors traffic and storage usage
* When limits are approached → it splits partitions and redistributes data
* Scaling is automatic and transparent to the application

What is a “hot” partition

* Too many reads/writes for a single partition key
* Happens when access is skewed to a small key set
* Partition hits its per-partition throughput limit
* Results in throttling even if table has free capacity

How DynamoDB handles it

* Auto-scaling can add capacity at table level
* But traffic for one partition key cannot be split
* Hot partition remains a bottleneck until access pattern changes

How to prevent hot partitions

* Use high-cardinality partition keys
* Add key sharding (e.g. user_id#bucket)
* Avoid time-based keys without randomness
* Spread traffic across multiple partition keys

Interview one-liner:

> DynamoDB auto-scales by splitting and rebalancing partitions, but if traffic is
concentrated on one partition key, that partition becomes hot and throttles,
so good key design is critical.
