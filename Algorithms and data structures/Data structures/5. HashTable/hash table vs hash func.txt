A **hash function** is a function that takes in an input (or "message") and produces
a fixed-size string of bytes. The output, commonly called the hash value or hash code,
is typically a "digest" that is unique to the specific input. The primary purpose of a
hash function is to quickly generate a hash code that serves as a representative value
for the input data. Hash functions are commonly used in various applications, such as
data integrity verification, cryptography, and data structures like hash tables.

On the other hand, a **hash table** is a data structure that uses a hash function to
map keys to indices in an array or bucket. It provides an efficient way to implement
an associative array (a collection of key-value pairs) by storing values at locations
computed directly from their keys. The hash function is used to determine the index
where an element should be placed or looked up in the table.

In summary, a hash function is a mathematical function that produces a fixed-size output
(hash code) from an input, while a hash table is a data structure that uses a hash
function to organize and quickly retrieve data based on keys. The hash table typically
consists of an array of buckets, and the hash function helps determine which bucket a
key should be associated with.
