Kafka consumers apply backpressure by controlling how fast they poll and commit
offsets, not by Kafka pushing fewer messages.


Kafka uses a pull-based model.
A consumer slows down by:
* Polling less frequently
* Pausing partitions
* Processing messages slower and delaying commits

Kafka simply retains data on disk while the consumer catches up.


### Key points interviewers expect
* Kafka does not push messages
* Backpressure is handled client-side
* Lag is the natural buffer


### One-liner to remember
> In Kafka, backpressure is consumer-controlled via pull and lag.
