1. **Transaction initiated** A transaction is created and broadcast
to the network.
2. **Transactions validated** Nodes in the network validate the transaction to
ensure it's legitimate (e.g., ensuring the sender has sufficient funds).
3. **Transactions Bundled & broadcasted** Valid transactions are bundled together
into a block by miners.
4. **Proof of work consensus problem solved** Miners solve a cryptographic puzzle
(proof of work) to validate the new block.
5. **Block added to the local chain and propagated to the network** The newly mined
block is added to the blockchain and propagated throughout the network.
