Race condition = outcome depends on execution order.

Why it happens:
* Shared mutable state
* Concurrent access (threads/processes/async)
* No proper synchronization

Effects:
* Inconsistent or corrupted data
* Hard-to-reproduce bugs

Prevention:
* Locks, semaphores
* Atomic operations
* Avoid shared state

Key idea:
> Uncontrolled concurrency leads to races
