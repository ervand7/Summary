The term **"Social Yeet" or "Migration"** in the context of smart contracts refers
to a method where an old contract is replaced with a new one by deploying it to a
completely different address. This migration isn't connected to the old contract in any
way, and users are expected to manually switch over to the new contract. It's a simpler
way of upgrading a system because it avoids complexities like proxy patterns, but it
comes with its own challenges.

For example, projects like Aave used this method when transitioning from Aave V1 to
Aave V2. A key disadvantage is that users must be convinced to move to the new contract,
which can be difficult, and the contract addresses change, which may complicate auditing
and user interaction. However, this method remains true to blockchain values by avoiding
complex upgrade systems that could introduce vulnerabilities.

In summary, **Social Yeet/Migration** provides a clean slate approach to upgrading a
smart contract system, but it requires community engagement to ensure a smooth transition
