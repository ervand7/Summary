Distributed locks ensure only one actor accesses a shared resource.

Common approaches:
* Redis (SET NX + TTL)
* Database row locks / advisory locks
* Zookeeper / etcd
* Cloud-managed locks (e.g. DynamoDB conditional writes)

Best practices:
* Always use timeouts (TTL)
* Handle lock expiration
* Make operations idempotent

Key idea:
> Locks coordinate work across processes or machines
