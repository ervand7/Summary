SQS

* Standard: no ordering guarantees
* FIFO: strict ordering per `MessageGroupId`
* Limitation:
  * Ordering is not global

---

SNS

* No ordering guarantees
* Messages can arrive out of order
* Fan-out amplifies reordering across subscribers

---

EventBridge

* No strict ordering guarantee
* Events may be delivered out of order
* Ordering depends on source and routing, not enforced by EventBridge

---

One-liner:

> Only SQS FIFO provides ordering (per message group); SNS and EventBridge do not
> guarantee order, so consumers must tolerate reordering.
