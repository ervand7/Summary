`PYTHONPATH` is an environment variable in operating systems that helps
the Python interpreter determine where to look for modules to import.
When you import a module in Python, the interpreter first searches for
this module in the directories specified in `PYTHONPATH`, and then in
standard locations.

Here are the key points about `PYTHONPATH`:

1. **Extends Standard Search Paths**: `PYTHONPATH` supplements the standard
search path, which includes the Python installation directories and the current
working directory. This allows Python to find modules that are not installed
in standard directories.

2. **Format**: `PYTHONPATH` should contain a list of directories separated by
colons (in Unix-like systems) or semicolons (in Windows).

3. **Usage**: This is particularly useful when you have your own modules or
packages located in non-standard directories, or when you are working on large
projects where modules are organized in different directories.

4. **Dynamic Modification**: You can modify `PYTHONPATH` in your script or
before running the script to include or exclude specific paths.

5. **Not Recommended for Deployment**: Although modifying `PYTHONPATH` can be
useful during development, for deployment it is better to use other methods,
such as installing packages via `pip`, to ensure dependency correctness.

It is important to understand that improper use of `PYTHONPATH` can lead to
conflicts or unexpected errors, especially if the variable includes directories
that contain modules with names that coincide with the names of standard Python
modules.
