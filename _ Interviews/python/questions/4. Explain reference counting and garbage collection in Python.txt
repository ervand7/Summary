Reference counting:
* Every object has a reference counter
* Incremented when a new reference is created
* Decremented when a reference is removed
* When count → 0, object is freed immediately

Garbage collection:
* Handles reference cycles (objects referencing each other)
* Periodically scans objects in generations
* Frees unreachable cycles

Summary:
> Reference counting is primary, GC cleans cycles
