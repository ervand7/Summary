👉 A cache can exist at multiple layers of a system, from the client to the database,
each with different trade-offs in latency, consistency, scope, and complexity.

Why multiple cache layers exist:
* Data can be reused at different points in the request path
* Earlier caches reduce load on all downstream components
* Different layers require different consistency guarantees

Main cache locations and how they differ:

1️⃣ Client-side cache (browser / mobile app)
* Stores data locally on the client
* Suitable for static or user-specific data

2️⃣ CDN / Edge cache
* Located geographically close to users
* Caches static assets or HTTP responses
* Best for images, JS, CSS, public APIs

3️⃣ Load balancer / reverse proxy cache (Nginx, Envoy)
* Caches HTTP responses before hitting app servers
* Limited awareness of business logic

4️⃣ Application in-memory cache (per instance)
* Stored inside the application process (maps, LRU)
* Fastest server-side access
* Risk of inconsistency across pods

5️⃣ Distributed cache (Redis / Memcached)
* Shared cache across all application instances
* Good balance of speed and consistency
* Survives app restarts
* Extra network hop and operational cost
* Becomes a critical dependency

6️⃣ Database cache (buffer pool, query cache)
* Managed by the database itself
* Transparent to the application
* Strong consistency with stored data
* Limited control from application side
* Still bounded by DB scalability
