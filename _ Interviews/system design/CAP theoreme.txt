### 🧠 CAP Theorem

In the presence of a network partition, a distributed system must choose
between Consistency and Availability.

C – Consistency:
Every read sees the most recent write (linearizability)

A – Availability:
Every request to a non-failed node receives a response

P – Partition Tolerance:
The system continues operating despite network partitions

Rule:
> When a partition occurs, you must choose: CP or AP
