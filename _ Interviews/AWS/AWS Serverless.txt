AWS Serverless means building applications on AWS without managing servers.

You write code and configure services, and AWS automatically:

* provisions servers
* scales up/down
* handles availability and maintenance

You pay only for actual usage, not idle infrastructure.

Typical serverless AWS services:

* AWS Lambda – run code on events
* Step Functions
* API Gateway – HTTP APIs
* DynamoDB – serverless database
* S3 – storage + event triggers
* EventBridge / SQS / SNS – event-driven messaging

In one sentence:

> *Serverless on AWS lets you focus on business logic while AWS handles servers, scaling,
and reliability.*
