The **maximum contract size limit in Ethereum** is **24 kilobytes (24 KB)**, which
equals **24,576 bytes**. This limit, established by [EIP-170]
(https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-170), helps prevent network bloat and ensures
efficient processing of smart contracts.

### **Key Points:**
- **Purpose:** Prevents excessively large contracts that could strain the network and
increase security risks.
- **Implications for Developers:** Encourages modular contract design, use of libraries,
and proxy patterns to stay within the size limit.
- **Checking Size:** Most development tools (like Hardhat or Truffle) display contract
size during compilation to help ensure compliance.
