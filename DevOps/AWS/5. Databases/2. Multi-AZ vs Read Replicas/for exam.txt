Multi-AZ vs Read Replica

Multi-AZ:
    - Amazon RDS for MySQL automatically provisions and maintains a synchronous
    standby replica in a different Availability Zone.
    - An exact copy of your production database in another AZ
    - Used for disaster recovery
    - In the event of a failure, RDS will automatically fail over to the standby instance
    (automatic failover)
    - Backups are taken from a secondary copy of your data
    - All updates or maintenance changes are applied to a secondary database. Multi-AZ
        rollovers are typically automatic but can be manually initiated

Read Replica:
    - A read-only copy of your primary database in the same AZ, cross-AZ, or cross-region
    - Used to increase or scale read performance
    - Great for read-heavy workloads and takes the load off your primary database
    for read-only workloads (e.g. business intelligence reporting jobs)
    - You can direct read traffic to a read replica if your source DB instance
    is unavailable for maintenance
    - Cross-region read replicas may have a delay between when data is written
    and when it is replicated
    - Cross-region read replicas in RDS typically replicate data asynchronously
    with a minimal lag
    - Once the failure is detected, you need to manually promote one of the read
    replicas to be the new primary database
    (not automatic failover)
