👉 **A load balancer can increase DB load by multiplying concurrency and synchronizing
traffic bursts across many instances.**


### Common ways this happens

**1. Connection pool explosion**
* Each instance has its own DB pool
* 30 instances × 10 connections = 300 DB connections
* DB gets overloaded despite “balanced” traffic


**2. Cache misses and stampedes**
* Cache expires or is cold
* All instances miss at the same time
* Many identical DB queries hit simultaneously


**3. Fast fan-out, slow DB**
* Load balancer accepts traffic faster than DB can handle
* Requests queue in app memory
* Latency and timeouts spike


**4. Autoscaling amplification**
* LB sends traffic to newly started pods
* New pods have empty caches
* DB load increases instead of decreasing


### Key insight (interview gold)
> Load balancers distribute traffic evenly, but downstream systems feel the *sum* of
all instance concurrency.


### One-liner interview answer

> Load balancers can unintentionally overload databases by multiplying connection
pools, synchronizing cache misses, and sending traffic faster than downstream systems
can handle.
