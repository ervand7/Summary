## 1️⃣ Core Philosophy
> APIs are contracts, not implementations.

Good naming means:
* Your API can survive 5–10 years
* Your clients don’t care how it’s implemented
* You can change internals without breaking users

Bad naming leaks internals.
Good naming describes business meaning.

---

## 2️⃣ Resource-Oriented Thinking (The Foundation)

Modern APIs are about resources, not actions.

### ❌ Wrong (action-based)

```
/getUser
/createOrder
/deletePayment
```

### ✅ Correct (resource-based)

```
/users
/orders
/payments
```

Rule:

> URLs are nouns. HTTP methods are verbs.

| HTTP Method | Meaning        |
| ----------- | -------------- |
| GET         | Read           |
| POST        | Create         |
| PUT         | Replace        |
| PATCH       | Partial update |
| DELETE      | Remove         |

---

## 3️⃣ Naming Resources (URLs)

### 3.1 Use plural nouns

```
/users
/orders
/cards
/transactions
```

Why?

* Consistent
* Works naturally with collections
* Avoids edge cases (`/user/123` looks odd)

---

### 3.2 Use lowercase + kebab-case

```
/user-profiles
/payment-methods
/card-transactions
```

❌ Avoid:

```
/UserProfiles
/user_profiles
/userProfiles
```

---

### 3.3 Avoid verbs in URLs

❌

```
/create-user
/get-transactions
/update-card
```

✅

```
POST   /users
GET    /transactions
PATCH  /cards/{cardId}
```

---

## 4️⃣ Hierarchies & Relationships

### 4.1 Parent → Child relationships

```
/users/{userId}/cards
/users/{userId}/transactions
/orders/{orderId}/items
```

Rule:

> Use nesting only when the child cannot exist without the parent

❌ Bad deep nesting

```
/users/{id}/accounts/{id}/cards/{id}/transactions
```

✅ Flatten when needed

```
/transactions?card_id=123
```

---

### 4.2 Many-to-many? Use a top-level resource

```
/memberships
/user-roles
```

---

## 5️⃣ Naming Actions (When You Really Need Them)

Sometimes pure REST is not enough.

### 5.1 Use sub-resources or verbs as nouns

❌

```
POST /cards/activate
```

✅

```
POST /cards/{id}/activation
DELETE /cards/{id}/activation
```

or

```
POST /cards/{id}:activate
```

👉 `:` is common in Google-style APIs.

---

### 5.2 Long-running operations

```
POST /cards/{id}/verification
GET  /operations/{operationId}
```

---

## 6️⃣ Query Parameters (Filtering, Sorting, Pagination)

### 6.1 Filtering

```
GET /transactions?status=approved
GET /cards?type=virtual
```

### 6.2 Time ranges

```
?from=2025-01-01
?to=2025-01-31
```

or

```
?created_at_gte=...
?created_at_lte=...
```

---

### 6.3 Pagination (pick one style and stick to it)

#### Offset-based

```
?limit=50&offset=100
```

#### Cursor-based (preferred for large systems)

```
?limit=50&cursor=eyJpZCI6...
```

---

### 6.4 Sorting

```
?sort=created_at
?sort=-created_at   // descending
```

---

## 7️⃣ Field Naming (JSON Body)

### 7.1 Use snake_case OR camelCase — never both

Choose once.

Recommended:

```json
{
  "user_id": "123",
  "created_at": "2025-01-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

or

```json
{
  "userId": "123",
  "createdAt": "2025-01-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

---

### 7.2 Be explicit

❌

```json
{ "status": "ok" }
```

✅

```json
{ "payment_status": "approved" }
```

---

### 7.3 Booleans must read naturally

✅

```json
"is_active": true
"has_3ds": false
```

❌

```json
"active": "yes"
"3ds": 1
```

---

## 8️⃣ Naming Enums

Enums should be:

* lowercase
* stable
* descriptive

```json
"status": "pending"
"status": "approved"
"status": "declined"
```

❌ Never expose internal states:

```
WAITING_FOR_PROVIDER_CALLBACK
```

---

## 9️⃣ Error Naming & Structure

### 9.1 Error codes are part of the API contract

```json
{
  "error_code": "card_not_found",
  "message": "Card does not exist"
}
```

✅ Good:

* snake_case
* stable
* machine-readable

❌ Bad:

```
ERR_10239
```

---

### 9.2 HTTP status codes must match semantics

| Status | Meaning                     |
| ------ | --------------------------- |
| 400    | Client error                |
| 401    | Not authenticated           |
| 403    | Authenticated but forbidden |
| 404    | Resource not found          |
| 409    | Conflict                    |
| 422    | Validation error            |
| 500    | Server error                |

---

## 🔟 Versioning

### 10.1 Prefer URL versioning

```
/v1/cards
/v2/cards
```

### 10.2 Never version fields

❌

```json
"user_name_v2"
```

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Naming Across Protocols (HTTP ↔ gRPC)

### REST

```
POST /cards/{id}/freeze
```

### gRPC

```proto
rpc FreezeCard(FreezeCardRequest) returns (FreezeCardResponse);
```

Rule:

> REST = resources
> gRPC = actions

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ What NOT to Expose

❌ Internal tech:

```
/redis-cache
/kafka-events
/sql-users
```

❌ Provider-specific:

```
/stripe-payment
/visa-card
```

✅ Abstract:

```
/payments
/cards
```

---

## 1️⃣3️⃣ Common Naming Mistakes (Real-World)

❌ Mixing styles

```
/getUsers
/cards/{card_id}/Activate
```

❌ Encoding logic in URLs

```
/users-with-active-cards
```

❌ Ambiguous naming

```
/data
/info
/details
```

---

## 1️⃣4️⃣ Interview-Ready Rules (Memorize These)

> 1. URLs are nouns, methods are verbs
> 2. Names reflect business meaning, not implementation
> 3. Plural resources, consistent casing
> 4. Stable enums & error codes
> 5. Flat over deeply nested
> 6. Version APIs, not fields

---

## 1️⃣5️⃣ Final API Naming Checklist

Before approving any API:

✅ Can I change DB without breaking clients?
✅ Can I add fields without version bump?
✅ Does naming match business language?
✅ Are errors machine-readable?
✅ Is it obvious what each endpoint does?
