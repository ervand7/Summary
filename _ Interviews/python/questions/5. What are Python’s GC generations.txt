Python GC uses generational garbage collection.

Generations:
* Gen 0 → new objects (collected most often)
* Gen 1 → objects that survived Gen 0
* Gen 2 → long-lived objects (collected least often)

How it works:
* Most objects die young
* Survivors are promoted to older generations
* Older generations are scanned less frequently

Key idea:
> Collect young objects often, old objects rarely
