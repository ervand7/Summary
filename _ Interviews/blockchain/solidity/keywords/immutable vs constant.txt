In Solidity, `immutable` and `constant` are two keywords used to define variables
with certain restrictions on their mutability, but they have different use cases
and behaviors. Here's a comparison:

### 1. **constant:**
   - **Definition:** The `constant` keyword is used for variables whose value is fixed
   at compile-time and cannot be changed thereafter.
   - **Initialization:** Must be assigned a value at the time of declaration.
   - **Storage:** These variables are stored directly in the bytecode, which means
   they do not consume storage on the blockchain.
   - **Usage:** Typically used for defining constants like mathematical constants or
   fixed addresses.
   - **Example:**
     ```solidity
     uint256 public constant MAX_SUPPLY = 1000000;
     ```

### 2. **immutable:**
   - **Definition:** The `immutable` keyword is used for variables whose value is set
   at deployment-time (in the constructor) and cannot be changed after deployment.
   - **Initialization:** Must be assigned a value either at the time of declaration or
   in the constructor. It cannot be modified after the contract is deployed.
   - **Storage:** These variables are stored in storage, but because their values are
   fixed after deployment, they can be accessed more efficiently than regular storage variables.
   - **Usage:** Useful for values that are known only at deployment but should remain
   constant afterward, such as contract addresses or configuration parameters.
   - **Example:**
     ```solidity
     uint256 public immutable deploymentTimestamp;

     constructor() {
         deploymentTimestamp = block.timestamp;
     }
     ```

### Summary:
- **`constant`:** Value is known at compile-time, must be assigned at declaration, and
stored in the bytecode.
- **`immutable`:** Value is known at deployment-time, must be assigned either at
declaration or in the constructor, and stored in the contract's storage.

These keywords help optimize gas usage and ensure the integrity of values that should
not change during the lifecycle of the contract.
