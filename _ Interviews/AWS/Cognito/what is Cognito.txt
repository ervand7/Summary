Cognito = authentication & user management, not business logic.

What you should know:

* User Pools → login, signup, JWT tokens, OAuth 2.0
* Identity Pools → AWS access for users
* JWT validation (access / ID tokens)
* Integration with API Gateway & ALB
* Auth flows: password, refresh, MFA
* Custom claims & triggers (Lambda)
* Common pain points: UX, limits, complexity

👉 Cognito answers “who is the user?”, not “what can they do?”
