**Difficulty** and **Total Difficulty** are two important metrics in the Ethereum
network that relate to the mining process:

### Difficulty
- **Difficulty** in Ethereum refers to how hard it is to find a valid hash for a new
block. It is a measure of how much computational work is required to mine a new block.
- The difficulty level is adjusted dynamically by the network to ensure that the
time between blocks remains relatively constant (approximately 15 seconds on average).
- As more miners join the network and more computational power is added, the
difficulty increases to maintain the block time. Conversely, if miners leave the
network, the difficulty decreases.

### Total Difficulty
- **Total Difficulty** is the cumulative sum of the difficulty levels of all blocks
up to a given point. It represents the total amount of computational work that
has been done to secure the blockchain from its inception to the current block.
- Total Difficulty is often used to determine the longest chain in cases where
there are competing forks. The chain with the highest total difficulty is considered
the valid chain, as it represents the most work done.

### Practical Example
- If block #1 has a difficulty of 1,000 and block #2 has a difficulty of 1,200, the
total difficulty at block #2 would be 2,200.
- The **Total Difficulty** metric is particularly useful during hard forks or chain
splits, where it helps in determining which chain has the most computational work
and should be considered the main chain.

These concepts are crucial for understanding how the Ethereum network maintains
security and consensus through the proof-of-work mechanism, although Ethereum is
transitioning to proof-of-stake with Ethereum 2.0.
