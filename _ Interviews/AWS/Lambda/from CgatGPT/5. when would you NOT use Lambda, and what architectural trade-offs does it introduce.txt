Don’t use Lambda when:

* Work is long-running or stateful
* You need predictable ultra-low latency
* Traffic is high and constant (cheaper on ECS/EKS)
* You have heavy native deps / CPU needs
* The system is chatty or tightly coupled

One-liner:

> Lambda is great for bursty, event-driven workloads, but I avoid it for long-running, 
stateful, low-latency, or always-on systems.
