## A. Scope (what exactly are we building?)

1. Is this Netflix for end users only (watching), or also the studio/admin side
(uploading, encoding, publishing)?
2. Are we doing movies only, or also episodic series, seasons, trailers, live streams?
3. Do we support offline downloads?
4. Do we support multiple user profiles per account (kids profile, maturity ratings)?
5. Are we in one region or global (multi-region + multiple CDNs)?

## B. Playback experience (the “core”)

6. Startup time target (time-to-first-frame)? Buffering target?
7. Required max quality: 1080p, 4K, HDR, Dolby Vision/Atmos?
8. What devices: web, iOS/Android, Smart TVs, consoles?
9. Do we need “Continue Watching”, “Up Next”, autoplay?
10. Do we support subtitles + multiple audio tracks + dubbing?

## C. Content delivery & streaming protocol

11. Which streaming: HLS, MPEG-DASH, both?
12. Do we require ABR (adaptive bitrate) ladders?
13. Do we need DRM (Widevine/FairPlay/PlayReady)?
14. Should playback be via signed URLs/tokens? Token TTL?
15. Are range requests required? (almost always yes)

## D. Catalog & discovery

16. How big is the catalog (titles, assets, metadata size)?
17. Search: simple title search or full-text, autocomplete, multilingual?
18. Do we need “Top 10”, “Trending”, regional rows, editorial picks?
19. Do we need per-user personalization of the homepage rows?
20. Should we support “Coming soon” and reminders?

## E. Recommendations & ranking (the hard + high impact part)

21. Do we need ML recommendations or simpler heuristics is fine for interview?
22. How fresh should personalization be (real-time vs hourly/daily batch)?
23. Signals: watch time, likes/dislikes, ratings, search, clicks, dwell time?
24. Cold start: new user / new title strategy?
25. A/B testing requirement for ranking and UI variants?

## F. Accounts, plans, payments

26. Subscription only, or also ads tier? (ads changes the whole system)
27. Concurrency limits: how many simultaneous streams per account?
28. Password sharing detection out of scope or in scope?
29. Geo restrictions / licensing rules (country availability windows)?
30. Parental controls + maturity ratings enforcement?

## G. Data correctness & reliability

31. Must “Continue Watching” update in real-time across devices?
32. Eventual consistency acceptable for recommendations/homepage?
33. SLA targets: playback availability, API availability?
34. Disaster recovery: multi-region failover required?
35. Data retention requirements for viewing history?

## H. Security, compliance, abuse

36. DRM mandatory? Watermarking needed?
37. Anti-piracy measures: token binding, short TTL, device attestation?
38. Rate limits / bot scraping of catalog?
39. Privacy regulations: GDPR/CCPA (delete history, export data)?
40. Audit logging requirements (admin changes, content publishing)?

## I. Observability (how we know it works)

41. Key metrics: startup time, rebuffer ratio, bitrate delivered, error codes?
42. How do we detect CDN failures and reroute?
43. Real-time monitoring vs batch analytics expectations?
44. What logging granularity is acceptable (cost)?
45. Incident playbooks: rollback configs, kill switches, feature flags?
