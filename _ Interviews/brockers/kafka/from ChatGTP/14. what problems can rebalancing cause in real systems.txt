Rebalancing can cause temporary pauses in consumption, increased latency, and
duplicate message processing if offsets are not managed correctly.


During a rebalance, consumers stop processing, partitions are revoked and reassigned,
and work may be interrupted. In real systems, frequent rebalances can seriously hurt
throughput and stability.


### Main problems rebalancing causes
* Processing pauses → higher end-to-end latency
* Duplicate processing → offsets committed too late
* Lost in-flight work → long-running handlers get interrupted
* Lag spikes → consumers restart from older offsets
* Rebalance storms → cascading failures under load


### One-liner to remember
> Rebalancing is necessary, but frequent rebalances are a production smell.
