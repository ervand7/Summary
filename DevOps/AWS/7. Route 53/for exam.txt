Route 53 is Amazon DNS service.
If at the exam you have choice between alias record and CNAME always choose an
alias record over CNAME.
Common DNS record types: SOA Record, CNAME Record, NS records, A records.


Simple Routing Policy.
If you choose the simple routing policy, you can only have one record with multiple IP
addresses. If you specify multiple values in a record, Route 53 returns all values
to the user in a random order.


Weighted Routing Policy.
If you see a scenario based question where it's talking about sending a certain
amount of traffic, a percentage to various different geographic locations,
think of Weighted Routing.


Health Checks.
 - You can set health checks on individual record sets
 - If a record set fails a health check, it will be removed from route 53
 until it passed the heath check
 - You can set SNS notifications to alert you about failed health checks


Failover Routing Policy.
If you see a scenario based question where it's talking about active/passive,
think of Failover Routing Policy.


Geolocation Routing Policy.
If you see a scenario based question where you've got your users in different
parts of the world, and you need to control where you're going to send them
based in their location, think of Geolocation Routing Policy.


Geoproximity Routing Policy.
Geoproximity Routing lets Amazon Route 53 route traffic to your resources based
on the geographic location of your users and resources.
 - You can also optionally choose to route more traffic or less to a given
 resource by specifying a value, known as a bias. A bias expands or shrinks the
 size of the geographic region from which traffic is routed to a resource
 - To use Geoproximity Routing, you must use Route 53 traffic flow.
