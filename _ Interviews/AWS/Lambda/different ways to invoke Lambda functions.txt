AWS Lambda can be invoked in three main ways, depending on who waits for the result
and who handles retries.

---

## 1️⃣ Synchronous (request → response)

Example:
User opens a website → clicks “Pay”

```
Browser → API Gateway → Lambda → response
```

Characteristics

* Client waits for the result
* Lambda returns success or error immediately
* If Lambda fails → caller sees the error
* Retries are client-side (browser, SDK, API Gateway)

👉 Like a normal HTTP request.

Typical use

* REST / GraphQL APIs
* Authentication
* Payments
* Anything where the user needs an immediate answer

---

## 2️⃣ Asynchronous (fire and forget)

Example:
User uploads a photo → thumbnails are generated later

```
S3 upload → Lambda (invoked later)
```

Characteristics

* Client does NOT wait
* Event is queued internally by AWS
* Lambda runs in the background
* AWS retries automatically if Lambda fails
* Failures can be routed to DLQ / destinations

👉 Like sending an email: you don’t wait for the recipient to read it.

Typical use

* Image / video processing
* Notifications
* Background data processing
* Event-driven workflows

---

## 3️⃣ Polling (Lambda pulls messages)

Example:
Order processing system

```
SQS queue ← Lambda polls → processes messages
```

Characteristics

* Lambda pulls messages itself
* Message stays in the queue until processed successfully
* If Lambda crashes → message is retried
* Retry behavior is controlled by the queue (visibility timeout, DLQ)

👉 Like a worker checking a task list.

Typical use

* SQS-based workers
* Kafka / stream processing
* Reliable background processing
* Decoupled services

## 🧠 One-line comparison

| Type    | Who waits? | Who retries? | Typical use cases        |
| ------- | ---------- | ------------ | ------------------------ |
| Sync    | Client     | Client       | APIs, user actions       |
| Async   | Nobody     | AWS          | Background jobs, events  |
| Polling | Nobody     | Queue        | Queues, streams, workers |
