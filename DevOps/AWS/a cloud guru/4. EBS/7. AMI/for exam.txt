AMIs: EBS vs Instance Store.
An AMI is just a blueprint (template) for an EC2 instance.
Amazon Machine Images are Region specific. To use one in another Region, it
needs to be explicitly copied there.

 - Instance store volumes are sometimes called ephemeral storage

 - Instance store volumes cannot be stopped. If the underlying host fails, you
 will lose your data

 - EBS-backed instances can be stopped. You will not lose the data on this
 instance if it is stopped

 - You can reboot both EBS and instance store volumes, and you will not
 lose your data

 - By default, both root volumes will be deleted on termination.
 However, with EBS volumes you can tell AWS to keep the root device volume.
