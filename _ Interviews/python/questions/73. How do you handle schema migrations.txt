Handle schema migrations safely by evolving the DB gradually.

Best practices:
* Use migration tools (Alembic, Django migrations)
* Make backward-compatible changes
* Deploy code before removing old columns
* Avoid long-running locks
* Test migrations on staging

Key idea:
> Change schema in small, reversible steps
