Use DynamoDB when you need massive scale, very low latency, and simple access
patterns - without managing servers.

Typical use cases:

* Key-value / lookup data (by PK, sometimes SK)
* User sessions & auth tokens
* Counters, rate-limits, quotas
* Event/state storage (IoT, clickstream)
* High-traffic apps with predictable queries

Not for: complex joins, ad-hoc queries, heavy analytics.

👉 Think: fast, simple, unlimited scale
