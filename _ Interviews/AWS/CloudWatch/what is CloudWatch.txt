CloudWatch = metrics, logs, alarms for AWS.

What you should know:

* Logs: Lambda / EC2 / ECS logs, log groups & streams
* Metrics: built-in (CPU, errors, latency) + custom metrics
* Alarms: trigger alerts (SNS, Slack) on thresholds
* Dashboards: visualize system health
* Log Insights: query logs (`filter`, `stats`, `count`)
* Retention & cost control: logs are not free forever

👉 Think: observability + alerting, not storage.
