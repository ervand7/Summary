Example: `cost=0.72..78391.17`

In a PostgreSQL `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` output, the `cost` values represent
estimated query execution costs. These cost values are used by the PostgreSQL
query planner to determine the most efficient way to execute a query. The
format of the cost values is generally `start-up cost..total cost`, and
they are measured in arbitrary units (usually not milliseconds).

- **Start-up Cost**: This is the estimated cost of setting up the initial
conditions for the query execution.

- **Total Cost**: This is the estimated total cost of executing the query, including
both the start-up cost and the cost of processing all rows.

In your example:
- `cost=0.72..78391.17` represents the estimated cost range for the entire query.
- `0.72` is the estimated start-up cost.
- `78391.17` is the estimated total cost.

These cost values help the query planner compare different query execution plans and
choose the one with the lowest estimated total cost. Lower costs generally indicate
more efficient query plans.

It's important to note that these cost values are just estimates and may not directly
correlate with actual execution time in milliseconds. The `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`
output also includes the `actual time` information, which provides the actual
execution time in milliseconds for each step of the query plan. This actual time
is measured during the query execution and gives you a more accurate idea of how
long the query took to run.
