## S3 — Questions to Ask When Creating a Bucket (Cost-Aware)

Beyond storage class, I always ask:

### 1️⃣ Access pattern

* How often is data read?
* Latency requirements?
  → choose Standard vs IA vs Glacier

### 2️⃣ Data retention & lifecycle

* How long must data be kept?
* When can it be:

  * moved to cheaper storage?
  * deleted automatically?
    → define Lifecycle Policies

### 3️⃣ Cost drivers

* Storage class cost
* Request costs (GET/PUT)
* Data transfer (especially cross-region)
* Retrieval costs for Glacier tiers

### 4️⃣ Compliance / retention constraints

* Legal retention?
* WORM / Object Lock required?


### 5️⃣ Versioning


### 6️⃣ Geography & availability
* Single-region vs multi-region access?

### Interview “gold” sentence

> Cost optimization in S3 is driven not only by storage class, but by access
patterns and lifecycle policies that control retention, tiering, and deletion over time.
