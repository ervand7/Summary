**Simple Hash**
A simple hash is typically used when there is a fixed number of items to be hashed,
such as the items in a block header, and when verifying the composite block integrity.
Simple hashing ensures that any change in the data results in a different hash,
which helps in verifying the integrity of the block as a whole.

**Tree-structured Hash**
When there is a variable number of items to be hashed, such as the many state changes
in a block, a tree-structured hash, specifically a Merkle Tree, is often used. This
structure allows for efficient and secure verification of the integrity of large sets
of data by organizing the hashes in a hierarchical tree format.
