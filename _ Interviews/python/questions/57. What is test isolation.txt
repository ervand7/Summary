Test isolation means each test runs independently.

What it ensures:
* Tests don’t depend on execution order
* No shared state between tests
* One test’s failure doesn’t affect others

How to achieve:
* Fresh data per test
* Proper setup/teardown
* Avoid global mutable state

Key idea:
> A test must pass or fail on its own
