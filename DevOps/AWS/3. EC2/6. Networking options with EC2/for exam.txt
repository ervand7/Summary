Network devices:
 - ENI.
 The process of attaching an Elastic Network Interface (ENI) to an EC2 instance
 while it is running is called a: "hot attach".
 For basic networking. Perhaps you need a separate management network from
 your production network or a separate logging network, and you need to do
 this at a low cost. in this scenario, use multiple ENIs for each network.

 - Enhanced Networking.
 For when you need speeds between 10 Gbps and 100 Gbps. Anywhere you need reliable,
 high throughput.

 - EFA.
 For when you need to accelerate High Performance Computing (HPC) and machine
 learning applications or if you see a scenario question mentioning HPC or ML
 and asking what network adapter you want, choose EFA.


Billing alarm:
The best approach to prevent a high bill from occurring in the future and identify
potential cost issues before they become too costly is to create a billing alarm.
 - Here’s how to set it up:
    Go to the AWS Management Console: Navigate to the CloudWatch service.
    Create an Alarm: Select “Billing” as the metric namespace, and set a threshold based
    on your budget.
    Configure Notifications: Set up SNS (Simple Notification Service) to send
    alerts via email, SMS, or other methods when the alarm is triggered.
