Kafka guarantees message ordering within a single partition by appending
messages sequentially to an immutable log. There is no ordering guarantee across
partitions.


Each partition is an append-only log.
Producers write messages in order, Kafka assigns monotonically increasing offsets,
and consumers read messages sequentially by offset, which preserves order inside
that partition.


### Key details interviewers look for
* Ordering = per partition
* Same partition key → same partition → same order
* Multiple partitions = parallelism, but no global order
* Consumer groups ensure only one consumer reads a partition at a time
