 - Snapshots are point-in-time photographs of volumes and are incremental in nature.
The volume can be used normally while the snapshot is in progress.

 - Snapshots exist on S3

 - The first snapshot will take some time to create.

 - Consistent Snapshots.
 Snapshots only capture data that has been written to your Amazon EBS volume,
 which might exclude any data that has been locally cached by your application or OS.
 For a consistent snapshot, it is recommended you stop the instance and take a snap.

 - Encrypted Snapshots.
 If you take a snapshot of an encrypted EBS volume, the snapshot will be encrypted
 automatically.

 - Sharing Snapshots.
 You can share snapshots, but only in the region in which they were created. To share
 the other regions, you will need to copy them to the destination region first.
