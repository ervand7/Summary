A Kafka producer can automatically retry sending a record if the send fails.

### How it works:
* The producer sends a record to the leader broker
* If the send fails (temporary error, network issue, leader change):
  * the producer retries sending the same record

### Key producer settings
* `retries` — how many times to retry (`0`, `3`, `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, etc.)
* `retry.backoff.ms` — delay between retries
* `delivery.timeout.ms` — total time allowed for all retries

### Important consequence (interview-critical)
Retries can cause duplicate messages.

That’s why:
* With retries + `acks=all` → you get at-least-once delivery
* To avoid duplicates, you need:
  * Idempotent producer (`enable.idempotence=true`)
  * or transactions (for exactly-once)

### One-liner to remember
> Kafka producers retry failed sends, but retries may cause duplicates unless idempotence
is enabled.
