In production, migrations must be safe, reversible, and automated.

Best practices:

* Use a migration tool (golang-migrate, Flyway, Liquibase)
* Run migrations before or during deploy, not manually
* Make migrations backward-compatible
* Avoid long locks (`ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` first, backfill later)
* Version and track migrations
* Test on staging with production-like data

Zero-downtime pattern:

1. Add new nullable column
2. Deploy code that writes both old + new
3. Backfill data
4. Switch reads
5. Drop old column later

One-liner (interview-ready):

> Production migrations must be automated, backward-compatible, and designed to
avoid long locks or downtime.
