DynamoDB is a non-relational database.

 - Stored on SSD storage

 - Spread across 3 geographically distinct data centers

 - Supports 2 read ways:
       - Eventually consistent read.
       Consistency across all copies of data is usually reached within a second.
       Repeating a read after a short time should return the updated data. Best
       read performance.
       - Strongly consistent read.
       Returns a result that reflects all writes that received a successful
       response prior the read.


 - DynamoDB Transactions:
     - If you see any scenario question that mentions ACID requirements, think
     DynamoDB Transactions
     - DynamoDB provides ACID across 1 or more tables within a single AWS account
     and region
     - All-or-nothing transactions. Multiple all-or-nothing operations
     - 3 options of read: eventual consistency, strong consistency and transactional
     - up to 25 items or 4 mb of data


 - On-Demand Backup and Restore:
     - Fill backup at any time
     - Zero impact on table performance or availability
     - Consistent within seconds and retained until deleted
     - Operates within same region at the source table


 - Point-in-Time Recovery:
     - Protect against accidental writes or deletes
     - Restore to any point in the last 35 days
     - Incremental Backups
     - Not enabled by default
     - Latest restorable: 5 minutes in the past


 - Multi-Master, Multi-Region Replication:
     - Globally distributed applications
     - Ypu need no enable DynamoDB streams for turning on global tables
     - Multi-region redundancy for disaster recovery or high availability
     - You will not have to rewrite your application
     - Replication latency under 1 second
