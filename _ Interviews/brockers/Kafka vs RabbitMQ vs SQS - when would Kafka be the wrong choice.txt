Kafka is the wrong choice when you need low-latency request/response, simple 
task queues, or fully managed infrastructure with minimal ops.


### When not to use Kafka
* Simple job queues
  * RabbitMQ / SQS are simpler and cheaper

* Per-message acknowledgments & routing
  * RabbitMQ excels at complex routing, priorities, TTL

* Very low latency (< milliseconds)
  * Kafka favors throughput over latency

* No ops / serverless environments
  * SQS requires almost zero operational effort

* Strict FIFO across all messages
  * Kafka only guarantees ordering per partition


### When Kafka *is* the right choice (contrast)
* High throughput event streams
* Replay & time travel
* Multiple independent consumers
* Event-driven architectures


### One-liner to remember
> Kafka is a log for streams, not a queue for tasks.
