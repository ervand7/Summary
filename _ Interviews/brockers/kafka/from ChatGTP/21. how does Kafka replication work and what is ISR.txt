Kafka replicates each partition across multiple brokers.
One replica is the leader, others are followers.
ISR (In-Sync Replicas) is the set of replicas that are fully caught up with the leader.


* Producers write only to the leader
* Followers replicate data from the leader
* A replica is in ISR if it:
  * Is alive
  * Has replicated all messages within a configured lag

Only ISR replicas are considered safe for acknowledgments and leader election.


### Key points interviewers expect
* Replication factor ≥ 3 in production
* `acks=all` waits for all ISR replicas
* If a follower falls behind → removed from ISR
* New leader is elected from ISR only


### Why ISR matters
* Prevents data loss
* Guarantees durability
* Enables safe failover


### One-liner to remember
> ISR = replicas that are caught up and safe to trust.
