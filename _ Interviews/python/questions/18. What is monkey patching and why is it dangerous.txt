Monkey patching = changing code at runtime.

What it is:
* Modifying classes, functions, or modules after import

Why dangerous:
* Hidden side effects
* Hard to trace bugs
* Breaks assumptions of other code
* Makes behavior non-obvious

When acceptable:
* Testing or controlled environments

Key takeaway:
> Monkey patching trades clarity for convenience
