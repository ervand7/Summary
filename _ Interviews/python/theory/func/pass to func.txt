In Python when we pass val to func:
1) if it has immutable data type in will not change inside the func
2) if it has mutable data type in will change inside the func
3) independent of the data type it will not change if we make reassign:
def func(arg):
    # it will be copy
    arg = 1

4) independent of the data type it passed with the same addr:
a = 1
print(hex(id(a)))  # 0x7ff0d81283a0
def func(arg):
    print(hex(id(arg)))  # 0x7ff0d81283a0
