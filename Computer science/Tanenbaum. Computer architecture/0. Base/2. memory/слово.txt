A machine word (or processor word) is the fundamental unit of data processed by a
computer's central processing unit (CPU). A machine word has a fixed size that
depends on the CPU architecture. Typically, a machine word consists of several
bytes (8 bits each), but its size can vary depending on the specific architecture.

It's important to note that machine words are usually processed as a whole by the
CPU. In other words, if a CPU is, for example, 32-bit, it will process 32-bit
machine words as a single entity. Similarly, a 64-bit CPU will work with 64-bit
machine words.

Machine words are used for performing operations such as arithmetic calculations,
logical operations, and data manipulation in the computer's memory. They are the
basic building blocks for executing processor instructions.

The size of a machine word in a CPU architecture is crucial for its performance
and its ability to process data of different types and sizes.
