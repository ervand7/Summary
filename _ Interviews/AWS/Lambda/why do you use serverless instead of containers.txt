Why do you use serverless instead of containers?

* Developers don’t manage infrastructure
* Faster delivery and experimentation
* Built-in scaling and reliability
* Teams can own code + IaC
* Often cheaper for event-driven workloads

One-liner:

> Serverless simplifies infrastructure and lets developers focus on business logic.
