Celery:
* Python task queue
* Tight integration with Django/Flask
* Uses Redis/RabbitMQ
* Good for background jobs inside Python apps

Kafka:
* Distributed event streaming platform
* High throughput, durable logs
* Multiple consumers, replayable events
* Good for event-driven architectures and data pipelines

SQS:
* Managed AWS message queue
* Simple, reliable, scalable
* At-least-once delivery
* Good for decoupling services in AWS

Rule of thumb:
> Celery = app-level tasks
> Kafka = event streams
> SQS = simple, reliable cloud queue
