It supports both user authentication and integrity of messages.

A digital signature serves two primary purposes:
1. **User Authentication**: It verifies the identity of the sender, ensuring that the
message was indeed sent by the claimed sender.
2. **Integrity of Messages**: It ensures that the message has not been altered during
transmission. If the message is tampered with, the digital signature will no longer match,
alerting the recipient to the change.
