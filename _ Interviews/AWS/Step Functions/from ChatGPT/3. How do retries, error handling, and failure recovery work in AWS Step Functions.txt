* Retries are configured per state using `Retry` with attempt limits and backoff
* Errors are matched by type and handled using `Catch` blocks
* Failures can route execution to fallback, compensation, or fail states
* Recovery is automatic via retries; Lambdas must be idempotent
* Execution history shows exactly where and why a workflow failed
