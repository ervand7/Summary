A deadlock happens when two or more transactions block each other forever,
each waiting for locks held by the others.

Example:

* T1 locks row A → waits for row B
* T2 locks row B → waits for row A

How PostgreSQL detects it:

* Builds a wait-for graph
* Periodically checks for cycles
* If found → aborts one transaction with a deadlock error, second transaction
 will be ok

Key point:

> PostgreSQL resolves deadlocks automatically by killing one transaction.

One-liner (interview-ready):

> A deadlock is a circular lock wait, and PostgreSQL detects it by finding cycles
in the wait-for graph.
