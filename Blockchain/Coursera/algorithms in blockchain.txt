### RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman):
- **Use in Blockchain**: RSA is a widely-used asymmetric encryption algorithm, but
it's not commonly used in blockchain networks like Bitcoin or Ethereum due to its
slower performance compared to other algorithms. Blockchain systems typically require
faster encryption methods, which is why RSA is not the primary choice for key generation
or encryption in these contexts.
- **General Use**: RSA is often used for secure data transmission, digital signatures,
and encryption of small amounts of data, particularly in secure communications like HTTPS.

### Keccak:
- **Use in Blockchain**: Keccak is the cryptographic hashing algorithm behind the
SHA-3 family. In Ethereum, Keccak is used for generating hashes, particularly in the
creation of addresses from public keys and in the process of verifying transactions.
Ethereum uses Keccak-256 instead of the standardized SHA-3 variant.
- **Functionality**: It produces a 256-bit hash value and is known for its security
and resistance to cryptographic attacks.

### SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit):
- **Use in Blockchain**: SHA-256 is the cryptographic hashing algorithm used by Bitcoin
and many other blockchains. It is fundamental in creating block hashes, mining, and
ensuring the integrity of data within the blockchain.
- **Functionality**: SHA-256 generates a 256-bit hash and is known for being
computationally secure, making it infeasible to reverse or find collisions (two
different inputs producing the same hash).

### ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography):
- **Use in Blockchain**: ECC is widely used in blockchain, particularly in Bitcoin
and Ethereum, for generating public-private key pairs. ECC allows for shorter key
lengths while providing equivalent security to longer keys generated by algorithms
like RSA.
- **Functionality**: It leverages the mathematics of elliptic curves over finite
fields, enabling efficient and secure cryptographic operations, which are crucial
for signing transactions and generating addresses.
