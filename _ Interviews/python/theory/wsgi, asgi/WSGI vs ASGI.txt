## 1️⃣ What is WSGI?

WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) is the older Python standard for web apps.

### Key properties

* Synchronous
* One request → one thread/process
* Designed for classic HTTP
* Blocking I/O

### Typical stack

```
Client → Nginx → Gunicorn/uWSGI → Flask/Django
```

### What WSGI is good at

* Simple REST APIs
* CRUD apps
* CPU-bound logic
* Predictable workloads

### Limitations

* ❌ No WebSockets
* ❌ No long-lived connections
* ❌ Inefficient for async I/O (DB, HTTP calls, streaming)

---

## 2️⃣ What is ASGI?

ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) is the modern successor to WSGI.

### Key properties

* Asynchronous (async/await)
* Event-loop based
* Supports multiple protocols
* Non-blocking I/O

### Supported protocols

* HTTP
* WebSockets
* Server-Sent Events (SSE)
* Background tasks

### Typical stack

```
Client → Nginx → Uvicorn/Hypercorn → FastAPI/Django ASGI
```

### What ASGI is good at

* WebSockets & real-time apps
* Streaming responses
* High-concurrency APIs
* I/O-bound systems

---

## 3️⃣ Core difference (one sentence)

> WSGI handles one request at a time per worker;
> ASGI handles many concurrent requests in one worker.

---

## 4️⃣ Execution model comparison

### WSGI (blocking)

```python
def app(environ, start_response):
    data = slow_db_call()   # blocks worker
    return response
```

### ASGI (non-blocking)

```python
async def app(scope, receive, send):
    data = await async_db_call()  # worker continues handling others
```

## 5️⃣ Performance implications

| Aspect         | WSGI                    | ASGI              |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------- |
| Concurrency    | Low (threads/processes) | High (event loop) |
| WebSockets     | ❌ No                    | ✅ Yes             |
| Long-polling   | ❌ Poor                  | ✅ Native          |
| Streaming      | ❌ Hard                  | ✅ Easy            |
| Resource usage | Heavy                   | Efficient         |
| Complexity     | Simple                  | Slightly higher   |

## 6️⃣ Servers comparison

| WSGI servers | ASGI servers |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| Gunicorn     | Uvicorn      |
| uWSGI        | Hypercorn    |
| mod_wsgi     | Daphne       |

## 7️⃣ Frameworks

### WSGI-only

* Flask
* Django (classic mode)

### ASGI-native

* FastAPI
* Starlette
* Sanic

### Dual-mode

* Django (WSGI + ASGI)
* Quart

---

## 8️⃣ Can ASGI run WSGI apps?

✅ Yes

* ASGI servers can wrap WSGI apps
* WSGI servers cannot run ASGI apps

---

## 9️⃣ When to choose what (practical rule)

### Choose WSGI if:

* Simple REST API
* No real-time features
* Team wants minimal complexity

### Choose ASGI if:

* WebSockets / SSE
* High concurrency
* Streaming
* Modern microservices
* You’re using FastAPI

## 🔟 Interview one-liner (memorize this)

> “WSGI is synchronous and limited to HTTP; ASGI is asynchronous, event-driven, and
supports real-time protocols like WebSockets.”
