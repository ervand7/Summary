The `VRFCoordinator` in Solidity, specifically in the context of Chainlink's
Verifiable Random Function (VRF), is a contract that coordinates the generation of
random numbers in a decentralized and provably fair manner. It acts as an intermediary
that facilitates the request and fulfillment of random numbers to ensure that they are
truly random and cannot be tampered with.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Chainlink VRF**:
   - Chainlink VRF is a system that provides smart contracts with secure and verifiable
   random numbers. It's particularly useful in decentralized applications (dApps) where
   randomness is needed, such as in gaming, lotteries, and NFT minting.

2. **VRFCoordinator**:
   - The `VRFCoordinator` is the central contract that manages the process of requesting
   and delivering random numbers.
   - It handles requests from smart contracts that need random numbers, coordinates with
   Chainlink's off-chain oracle nodes to generate these random numbers, and then returns
   the results back to the requesting contract in a secure manner.

3. **How It Works**:
   - **Request**: A smart contract calls the `requestRandomness` function from Chainlink's
   VRF. This function typically involves sending some LINK tokens as payment for the
   randomness request.
   - **Fulfillment**: The `VRFCoordinator` takes this request, passes it to the Chainlink
   VRF oracle nodes, and waits for them to generate the random number. Once generated,
   the oracle nodes send back the result to the `VRFCoordinator`.
   - **Delivery**: The `VRFCoordinator` then calls the `fulfillRandomness` function in the
   original requesting contract, passing along the random number.

4. **Security**:
   - The randomness is verifiable because it is derived from a combination of the block
   hash and a secret key only known to the oracle, ensuring that neither the smart
   contract nor the VRF oracle can predict or manipulate the outcome.

### Example Usage:
```solidity
import "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/VRFConsumerBase.sol";

contract MyRandomContract is VRFConsumerBase {
    bytes32 internal keyHash;
    uint256 internal fee;

    constructor(address _vrfCoordinator, address _link)
        VRFConsumerBase(_vrfCoordinator, _link) {
        keyHash = 0x6c3699283bda56ad74f6b855546325b68d482e983852a19e7d6104db4d7b06c1;
        fee = 0.1 * 10 ** 18; // 0.1 LINK
    }

    function requestRandomNumber() public returns (bytes32 requestId) {
        return requestRandomness(keyHash, fee);
    }

    function fulfillRandomness(bytes32 requestId, uint256 randomness) internal override {
        // Use the random number
    }
}
```
In this example:
- The contract requests a random number from the Chainlink VRF via the `VRFCoordinator`.
- The `VRFCoordinator` handles the process and eventually calls `fulfillRandomness` in
the contract, delivering the random number.

This system ensures that the randomness is generated in a way that is both secure and
verifiable by anyone.
