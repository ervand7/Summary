How lifecycle rules work:

* Automatically transition objects between storage classes (e.g. Standard → IA → Glacier)
* Expire (delete) objects after a set time
* Can be based on object age, prefix, tags, or versions
* Evaluated daily by S3 (not real-time)

Common production mistakes:

* Moving data to IA/Glacier too early → high retrieval costs
* Forgetting noncurrent version rules → storage grows silently
* Not cleaning up failed multipart uploads
* Applying rules to the wrong prefix or tag
* Assuming transitions happen immediately at exact timestamps

Key takeaway:

> Lifecycle rules save money, but misconfigured rules can quietly increase cost or break data access.
