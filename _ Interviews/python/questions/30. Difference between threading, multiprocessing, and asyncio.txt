threading:
* Multiple threads in one process
* Shares memory
* Limited by GIL → no CPU parallelism
* Best for I/O-bound tasks

multiprocessing:
* Multiple processes
* Separate memory, separate GIL per process
* True parallelism on multiple cores
* Best for CPU-bound tasks

asyncio:
* Single-threaded, event-driven
* Cooperative multitasking
* Very efficient for many I/O operations
* Requires async-compatible code

Rule of thumb:
> Threads for I/O, processes for CPU, asyncio for high-concurrency I/O
