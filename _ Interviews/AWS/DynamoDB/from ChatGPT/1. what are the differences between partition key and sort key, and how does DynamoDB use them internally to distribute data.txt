Partition key vs sort key in DynamoDB

Partition key:

* Mandatory attribute
* Hashed by DynamoDB to determine the physical partition
* Controls data distribution and scalability
* Items with the same partition key go to the same partition

Sort key:

* Optional attribute (used with partition key)
* Determines item ordering within a partition
* Enables range queries (>, <, BETWEEN, begins_with)
* Allows multiple items per partition key

How DynamoDB uses them internally:

* Hash(partition key) → selects physical partition
* Sort key → stored in sorted order inside that partition
* Read/write capacity is consumed per partition
* Poor partition key choice → hot partitions and throttling

Interview one-liner:

> DynamoDB hashes the partition key to distribute data across partitions, while the
sort key orders items within a partition and enables efficient range queries.
Good partition keys prevent hot partitions and enable horizontal scaling.
