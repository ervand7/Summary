Default arguments are evaluated once at function definition time.

Problem:
* Mutable default is shared between calls
* Changes persist across function calls

Example issue:
* list/dict keeps old values unexpectedly

Safe pattern:
* Use None as default
* Create mutable object inside the function

Key takeaway:
> Mutable defaults cause hidden shared state
