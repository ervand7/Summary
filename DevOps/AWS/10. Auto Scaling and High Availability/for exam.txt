Anytime you see scaling question, keep the 3 W's in mind:
What do we scale?
Where do we scale?
When do we scale?

What makes a template? What goes into a launch template?
AMI, EC2, instance size, security groups and potentially networking information

Launch template. The most up-to-date and flexible way to create a template.

Launch configurations. The older version. It's not "wrong" to use them, but if
possible, use templates.

User data is included in the template configuration.

Change. Can be versioned. Configurations are immutable.

Networking. Configurations don't include networking information. Templates could.
Auto scaling groups will contain the location of where your instances will live

Auto scaling is vital to creating a highly available application.
Remember to select answers that spread resources out over multiple AZs and
utilize load balances.

ELB. It's vital to select a load balancer for the instances to live behind.

Limits. Min, max and desired are the 3 important settings.

Notifications. SNS can act as a notification tool.

Balancing. Auto scaling will balance your EC2 instances across the AZ.
