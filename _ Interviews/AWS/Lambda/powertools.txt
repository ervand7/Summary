AWS Lambda Powertools is a set of official AWS utilities (for Python, TypeScript, Java)
that helps you write cleaner, more reliable Lambda code.

In short: it gives you logging, metrics, and tracing out of the box — the *right* way.

Why it exists:

* Structured logging (JSON, correlation IDs)
* Custom metrics (CloudWatch-friendly)
* Tracing helpers (X-Ray)
* Common patterns (idempotency, parameters, batch processing)

One-liner (interview-style):

> AWS Lambda Powertools is an AWS-maintained utility library that standardizes logging,
metrics, and tracing for Lambda functions and reduces boilerplate code.

Interview one-liner
> “I use AWS Lambda Powertools’ idempotency utility, which stores idempotency keys in DynamoDB
and guarantees safe retries with minimal code.”
