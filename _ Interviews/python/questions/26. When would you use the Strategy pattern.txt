Strategy pattern encapsulates interchangeable algorithms.

When to use:
* Multiple ways to perform an action
* Behavior changes at runtime
* Want to avoid large if/else blocks

Example:
* Different pricing, sorting, or validation logic

Key idea:
> Strategy lets you swap behavior without changing code
