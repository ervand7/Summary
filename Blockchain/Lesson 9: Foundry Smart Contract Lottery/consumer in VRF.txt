In the context of Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function), a **consumer**
typically refers to a smart contract that requests and consumes random numbers
generated by the Chainlink VRF service. The consumer contract interacts with the
Chainlink VRF to obtain randomness that can be used for various purposes, such as
in gaming, lotteries, NFTs, or any other application where secure and unpredictable
randomness is required.
