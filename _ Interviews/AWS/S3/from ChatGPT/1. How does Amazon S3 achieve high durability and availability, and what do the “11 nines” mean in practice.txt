Short answer:

Amazon S3 stores multiple copies of every object across several physically 
separate Availability Zones within a region. If disks, servers, or even an entire 
AZ fail, your data is still available.

“11 nines” durability (99.999999999%) means:

* For 1 billion objects, you might lose ~1 object every 10,000 years
* Data loss is *extremely* unlikely

Key takeaway:

> S3 protects against hardware and AZ failures, but not against user mistakes (deletes,
overwrites) — for that you need versioning, replication, or backups.
