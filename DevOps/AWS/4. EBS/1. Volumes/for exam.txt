EBS - highly available and scalable volumes you can attach to an EC2 instance.

 - Location.
 Volumes exist on EBS. EBS volumes will always be in the same AZ as EC2.

 - Resizing.
 Resize on the fly. You do not stop or restart your instance. However,
 you will need to extend the filesystem in the OS so the OS can see the resized
 volume.

 - Volume type.
 Switch volume types. You can change volume types on the fly (e.g., go from gp2 to io2).
 You do not need to stop or restart the instance.
