👉 Rate limiting algorithms differ mainly in how they handle bursts,
fairness over time, and implementation cost.

1️⃣ Fixed window counter
What it does:
* Counts requests in a fixed time window (e.g. 100 req / minute)
* Resets counter at window boundary

Behavior:
* Allows bursts at window edges
* Simple but inaccurate under spikes

Pros:
* Very easy to implement
* Low overhead

Cons:
* Burst amplification at window reset
* Poor fairness

Typical use:
* Simple internal limits, low-risk endpoints


2️⃣ Sliding window
What it does:
* Calculates rate over a moving time window
* Uses timestamps or sub-windows
1) Приходит запрос в момент времени T
2) Смотрим интервал [T − window … T]
3) Считаем, сколько запросов было в этом интервале
4) Если их меньше лимита — пропускаем запрос и добавляем T в список
   Иначе — отклоняем

Behavior:
* Smooths traffic over time
* More accurate than fixed window

Pros:
* Better fairness
* Reduced edge bursts

Cons:
* Higher memory and CPU cost
* More complex implementation

Typical use:
* User-facing APIs requiring fairness


3️⃣ Token bucket
What it does:
* Tokens are added at a fixed rate
* Each request consumes a token
* Bucket has a max capacity

Behavior:
* Allows short bursts
* Enforces long-term average rate

Pros:
* Burst-friendly
* Industry standard (Envoy, NGINX)

Cons:
* Slightly more complex logic

Typical use:
* Public APIs, gateways, per-user limits


4️⃣ Leaky bucket
What it does:
* Requests enter a queue
* Processed at a constant rate

Behavior:
* Smooths traffic strictly
* Bursts are delayed or dropped

Pros:
* Very stable downstream load

Cons:
* Adds latency
* Bursts are not tolerated

Typical use:
* Protecting sensitive downstream systems


Key behavioral differences:
* Fixed window → bursty and unfair
* Sliding window → fair but expensive
* Token bucket → burst-tolerant and practical
* Leaky bucket → smooth but latency-heavy

One-line interview answer:
> Fixed and sliding windows control request counts over time, while token and
leaky buckets control flow; token bucket allows bursts with an average limit,
and leaky bucket strictly smooths traffic at the cost of latency.
