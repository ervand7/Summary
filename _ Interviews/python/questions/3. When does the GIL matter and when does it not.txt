GIL matters:
* CPU-bound workloads
* Multiple threads doing heavy Python computation
* True parallelism on multiple cores is needed

GIL does NOT matter:
* I/O-bound tasks (network, disk, DB)
* Single-threaded programs
* Code that releases the GIL (C extensions, NumPy)

Rule of thumb:
> Threads help I/O, processes help CPU
