👉 A producer can explicitly choose the partition, not only the topic or key.

How it works (concise):

* Producer can send a record with:
  * topic only → Kafka uses the partitioner
  * topic + key → partition = `hash(key) % partitions`
  * topic + partition → producer forces the partition

Important notes:
* If you explicitly set the partition, the key is ignored for routing
* You must ensure:
  * correct load balancing
  * ordering guarantees yourself

Interview takeaway:
> Kafka allows producers to control partition selection either via keys or by
explicitly specifying the partition.
