CloudWatch is used for monitoring. It is the main tool for anything alarm related.
CPU utilization and network throughput can be viewed using the
default CloudWatch metrics.

CloudWatch Logs is the place for logs. All another AWS services can be integrated
with CloudWatch.

Alarms. There are no default alarms. Anything you want to hear about must be created.

Default vs Custom. AWS can't see past the hypervisor level logs for EC2 instances
by default.

Managed Services. The more manager service is, the more checks you get out of the box.

Basic vs Detailed. Basic id 5-minute intervals, whereas detailed is 1-minute

Logs should go to CloudWatch logs except for situations where we don't need to process
them. Then, they should go straight to S3

Go-to tool. Generally, favor CloudWatch Logs, unless the exam asks for a real-time solution

Alarms. CloudWatch alarms can be used to alert if your filter patterns are found.

Agent based. The CloudWatch agent must be installed and configured. It's not automatic.

SQL. If exam mentions SQL, think CloudWatch logs insights.

Amazon managed Grafana - fully managed service for data visualisation. Allows
instant querying, correlating and visualizing of metrics, logs and traces.

Amazon managed service for Prometheus - serverless, Prometheus-compatible,
PromQL-compatible service used for securely monitoring container metrics at scale.

Security and Scaling. Both services let AWS handle the high availability and automatic
scaling of infrastructure. Leverage VPC endpoints for secure VPC access.

Grafana data sources. Several built-in data sources, including Amazon CloudWatch,
Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus and AWS X-ray

Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus Uses. Leverage the service for Amazon
EKS clusters or even self-managed Kubernetes clusters

Amazon Managed Grafana Uses. Container metrics visualization (EKS, ECS, or
self-hosted kubernetes clusters), IoT edge device data, and operational teams.

Real time means Kinesis.

A period is the length of time associated with a specific Amazon CloudWatch statistic.
The default period value is 60 seconds.
