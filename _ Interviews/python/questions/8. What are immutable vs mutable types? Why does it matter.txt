Immutable types:
* Cannot be changed after creation
* Examples: int, float, str, tuple, frozenset

Mutable types:
* Can be changed in place
* Examples: list, dict, set

Why it matters:
* Immutables are hashable → can be dict keys / set items
* Mutables can cause side effects
* Affects function arguments and default values

Key takeaway:
> Mutability affects safety, hashing, and behavior
