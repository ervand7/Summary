👉 In most real systems, producers and consumers live in different microservices.

* Producers usually belong to services that create events (orders, payments, users, etc.)
* Consumers belong to services that react to those events (notifications, analytics,
 billing, fraud, etc.)
* Kafka acts as a decoupling layer between them

Important nuance:
* A single microservice can be both a producer and a consumer (very common)
* But producers and consumers are logically separate roles, even if sometimes
 deployed together

Interview-style takeaway:
> Kafka is typically used to decouple microservices, where event-producing services
and event-consuming services are deployed independently.
