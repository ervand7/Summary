API Gateway controls *who* can call your Lambda and *from where*.

* Outside access → API Gateway exposes a public HTTP endpoint
  👉 browsers, mobile apps, external services can call your Lambda

* Inside access → API Gateway is private (VPC / IAM-restricted)
  👉 only internal services (other Lambdas, EC2, VPC resources) can call it

Why this matters:

* Central auth (IAM, JWT, API keys)
* Rate limiting, throttling
* You don’t expose Lambda directly

One-liner:

> API Gateway is the controlled door to your Lambda — public or internal.
