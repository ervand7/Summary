Soft deletes mean marking a row as deleted instead of physically removing it.

Common approach:

```sql
deleted_at TIMESTAMP NULL
```

* `NULL` → active
* NOT NULL → deleted

How to handle them properly:

* Always filter:

  ```sql
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL
  ```
* Add partial indexes:

  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX ON users(id) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
  ```
* Avoid `UNIQUE` conflicts by including `deleted_at` or using partial unique indexes
* Optionally hard-delete old data with background jobs

Why this works:

* Easy recovery
* Audit/history support
* No immediate data loss

One-liner (interview-ready):

> Soft deletes use a delete flag or timestamp, require consistent filtering, and
benefit from partial indexes.
