> There is no hard-coded fixed limit to the number of goroutines in a Go
program — you can have millions of them, limited only by available memory.

## 💡 Why is that possible?
Because goroutines are lightweight compared to OS threads:

* Each goroutine starts with a tiny stack (about 2 KB)
* The stack grows and shrinks as needed
* Go runtime schedules them cooperatively using its own scheduler


## 🧪 In practice:
You can easily spawn 100,000+ goroutines, even on a regular laptop.

```go
for i := 0; i < 1_000_000; i++ {
    go func() {
        select {} // block forever
    }()
}
```

✅ This can run fine — until you run out of memory.


## ⚠️ Real limit:
* Limited by RAM and virtual memory
* On 64-bit systems, you can go well into millions of goroutines
* But keep in mind: creating too many goroutines can degrade performance,
especially if they’re all active (CPU-bound)



## ✅ Best practice:
* Goroutines are cheap, but not free
* Avoid millions unless they’re mostly idle (e.g., waiting on channels)
* Monitor memory usage with `runtime.NumGoroutine()` or `pprof`
