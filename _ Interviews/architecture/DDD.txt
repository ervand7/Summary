* **DDD** = **Domain-Driven Design**.
* Itâ€™s an **approach to software design** where the **business domain and its
logic drive the structure and behavior of the software**.

ðŸ‘‰ DDD is **not about technology first**, but about **modeling the real-world
problem accurately in code**.


## ðŸ”‘ 2. Key Concepts You Should Know

| Concept                      | What It Means (Simple)                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Domain**                   | The business area you are modeling (e.g., payments, orders, wallets).        |
| **Entity**                   | An object with **identity** (e.g., `User`, `Order`, `Wallet`).               |
| **Value Object**             | An object without identity (e.g., `Money`, `Email`, `Coordinates`).          |
| **Aggregate**                | A **root entity** and related entities that form a **consistency boundary**. |
| **Repository**               | Abstracts storage (DB, cache, etc.). Works with **Aggregates**.              |
| **Service (Domain Service)** | Business logic that doesnâ€™t naturally belong to a specific entity.           |
| **Application Service**      | Orchestrates use cases, but contains no business logic.                      |
| **Bounded Context**          | A **logical boundary** where a specific domain model applies.                |


âœ… It leads to:
* **Testable business logic** without dependency on frameworks or databases.
* **Code that speaks the business language** (ubiquitous language).


## âœ… Must-Know Practical Example:
```go
// Domain layer
type Wallet struct {
	ID      string
	Balance int64
}

func (w *Wallet) CanWithdraw(amount int64) bool {
	return w.Balance >= amount
}

func (w *Wallet) Withdraw(amount int64) error {
	if !w.CanWithdraw(amount) {
		return errors.New("insufficient funds")
	}
	w.Balance -= amount
	return nil
}
```

Business logic **lives inside the domain model** â†’ reusable, testable, decoupled.


## ðŸ”‘ 3. DDD and Microservices

* **DDD helps you split large systems** â†’ each microservice can be a **Bounded Context**.
* But DDD is **not only for microservices**â€”it works well in monoliths too.
