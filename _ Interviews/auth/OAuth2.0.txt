### 🤔 Why use OAuth 2.0 (e.g., GitHub login) in your app?

You **can** let users create a login and password in your app — but using OAuth 2.0
brings **major advantages**:


### ✅ Benefits of OAuth 2.0 (e.g., GitHub login):
1. **No password handling**
   * You don’t need to build login forms, store passwords, or manage password resets.
   * No risk of password leaks or hacks — GitHub handles it all.

2. **Faster login**
   * One-click login for users — no need to register or remember another password.

3. **Built-in trust**
   * Users already trust GitHub (or Google), but may hesitate to trust a small app
   with their credentials.

4. **Verified identity**
   * You get a real GitHub user with a verified email — useful for apps aimed at developers.


### ❌ Downsides of building your own login system:
* You must handle:
  * Secure password storage (bcrypt, hashing, salting)
  * Reset-password logic (emails, tokens)
  * Security attacks (brute force, leaks, etc.)
* It’s time-consuming and error-prone.


### 💡 Summary:

| Your Own Login            | OAuth (GitHub login)           |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Full control              | No passwords to manage         |
| More code & security risk | Quick, secure login (1 click)  |
| You handle all auth       | GitHub handles auth & identity |


So, **OAuth 2.0 makes login safer and easier**, especially for small apps or
developer-focused tools. You avoid reinventing the wheel and provide a better user
experience.
