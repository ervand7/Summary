Exceptions are objects raised during runtime errors.

Internally:
* Error creates an exception object
* Interpreter unwinds the call stack
* Looks for a matching except block
* If found → handles it
* If not → program terminates with traceback

Key idea:
> Exceptions propagate up the stack until handled
