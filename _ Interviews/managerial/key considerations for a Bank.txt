### 1️⃣ Security (baseline)

* Encryption at rest and in transit
* Strict IAM / least privilege
* Key management (KMS, rotation)

### 2️⃣ Auditing

Auditing = the ability to reconstruct who did what, when, and why.

For a bank this means:

* Immutable logs (append-only, tamper-proof)
* Every action is:

  * attributable to an identity
  * timestamped
  * non-erasable
* Full trace from request → business action → data change

Examples:

* Ledger-style transaction logs
* API access logs
* Admin actions (config changes, key access)

### 3️⃣ Why auditing is critical for banks

* Regulatory compliance (PCI DSS, SOX, AML, etc.)
* Fraud investigation
* Dispute resolution
* Internal & external audits
