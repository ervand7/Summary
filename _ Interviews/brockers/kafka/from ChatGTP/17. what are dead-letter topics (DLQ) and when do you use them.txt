A dead-letter topic (DLQ) is a separate Kafka topic where messages that repeatedly
fail processing are sent so the main consumer flow can continue.


After exceeding retry limits, a consumer publishes the problematic message to a DLQ
(with metadata like error, original topic/partition/offset) and commits past it to
avoid blocking the partition.


### When you use a DLQ
* Poison messages (bad schema, invalid data)
* Non-recoverable business errors
* Preventing one bad event from blocking an entire partition
* Post-mortem analysis and manual replay


### Key points interviewers expect
* DLQ is a last resort, not a retry mechanism
* Ordering is preserved until the message is explicitly quarantined
* DLQ messages should include context for debugging
* DLQ consumers are usually separate tools or pipelines


### One-liner to remember
> DLQ isolates poison messages so the system can keep moving.
