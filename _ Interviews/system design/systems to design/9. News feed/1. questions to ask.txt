## A. Scope (what exactly are we building?)

1. Is this a social “home feed” (friends/following) or a “news” feed (topics + publishers)?
2. Is it “timeline only” (chronological) or “ranked feed” (ML/heuristics)?
3. Do we support only text posts, or also images/video links?
4. Is commenting/likes/shares in scope, or only feed generation + read path?
5. Do we need notifications (push/email) as part of the design?

## B. Audience graph & relationships

6. What is the relationship model: friends (mutual) or follow (one-way)?
7. Do we support groups/pages (one-to-many publishers)?
8. Do we need privacy levels (public/friends-only/custom lists)?
9. Are blocks/mutes required (filtering certain authors)?

## C. Feed semantics (what shows up?)

10. Which events create feed items: posts only, or also likes/comments/reposts?
11. Any content rules: hide deleted posts, hide “reported/flagged” content?
12. Do we need dedup (same story shared multiple times)?
13. How far back can a user scroll (7 days? 30 days? “infinite”)?

## D. Ranking & freshness

14. Chronological or ranked? If ranked: what are top signals (recency, affinity, engagement)?
15. Do we need A/B experiments (multiple ranking versions)?
16. Hard latency target for feed load (p95 < 200ms? 500ms?) and for “new post appears”?
17. How “fresh” must the feed be (seconds vs minutes)?

## E. Scale & traffic shape

18. DAU/MAU? Typical follows/friends per user? (p50/p99)
19. Feed reads QPS vs writes QPS? Peak patterns (morning spikes)?
20. Average feed page size (20 items?) and pagination style (cursor vs offset)?
21. Data sizes: post payload size, media size, metadata size?

## F. Consistency & correctness

22. When someone posts, must followers see it immediately?
23. Consistency model acceptable: eventual for feed, strong for post creation?
24. What happens on edits: update existing feed items or treat as new event?
25. Deletions: must disappear instantly from all feeds?

## G. Storage & data retention

26. How long do we store feed materialization (if we precompute)? TTL?
27. Do we need “seen/read” state, or just return items?
28. Do we store per-user feed as a list, or compute on demand?

## H. Anti-abuse, security, and privacy

29. Spam prevention needed (rate limits, shadow bans)?
30. Do we need content moderation pipeline (reporting, takedown)?
31. Any compliance constraints (PII, GDPR “right to be forgotten”)?

## I. Observability & ops

32. Core SLIs: feed p95 latency, empty-feed rate, freshness lag, error rate?
33. Backfill/rebuild needs: can we recompute feeds after bugs/ranking change?
34. Multi-region requirement (active-active reads?) and DR (RPO/RTO)?
