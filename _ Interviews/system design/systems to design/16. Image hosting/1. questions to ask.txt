## A. Scope (what exactly are we building?)

1. Is this consumer image hosting (like Imgur) or a product feature for an app (like “upload
profile photos”)?
2. Is it private-by-default (needs auth) or public-by-default (anyone can view)?
3. Are we hosting only images, or also short videos / GIFs (animated)?
4. Do we need albums/collections, or just individual images?
5. Do we need image editing features (crop/rotate/filters) or just hosting?

## B. Core user flows (must-haves)

6. Main flows: upload → view → share link → delete? Anything else (replace image, move to album)?
7. Do we need multiple sizes (thumbnail/medium/original) generated automatically?
8. Do we need metadata extraction (width/height, EXIF, camera model, GPS)?
9. Do we need tagging + search (by tags / title / user)?
10. Do we need “feed” or “trending” like a social site, or no ranking?

## C. Access control & sharing

11. Who can view an image: owner-only, selected users, anyone with link, fully public?
12. Do we need signed URLs with TTL for private images?
13. Do we need hotlink protection (only allow embedding from approved domains)?
14. Any requirement to revoke links immediately (token rotation / versioned tokens)?
15. Do we need audit logs (“who viewed/downloaded”)?

## D. Upload behavior & client constraints

16. Typical file sizes (mobile photos ~2–8MB, or pro photos 30–80MB)?
17. Max file size and max resolution?
18. Expected upload patterns: single image, multi-upload, batch (100s) from camera roll?
19. Need resumable uploads / chunking (bad networks)?
20. Do we need client-side direct-to-storage uploads (pre-signed URLs) vs proxy through
our servers?

## E. Transformations & delivery (the “image” part)

21. Which transformations are required: resize, format conversion (JPEG/PNG/WebP/AVIF),
quality settings?
22. Do we need dynamic resize on-the-fly (via CDN/image proxy) or precompute fixed variants?
23. Do we support content negotiation (serve WebP/AVIF if client supports)?
24. Do we need watermarks for certain images?
25. Latency targets: first byte for image < 100ms from CDN? p95 upload finalize < 1s?

## F. Scale & performance targets

26. How many users (DAU/MAU) and how many uploads/day?
27. Peak upload QPS and peak image view QPS (views usually dwarf uploads)?
28. Total storage size target (TB/PB) and retention policy?
29. Global product (multi-region) or single region?
30. CDN required? Any “must use” cloud provider?

## G. Correctness, reliability, and consistency

31. After upload, must the image be immediately viewable (strong consistency) or eventual is OK?
32. What’s acceptable if transformations are still running—show original first, or “processing…”?
33. Durability requirements (object storage-level), and DR needs (RPO/RTO)?
34. Do we need exactly-once processing for variants, or is idempotent retry enough?
35. Do we need deduplication (same image uploaded multiple times) by hash?

## H. Safety, abuse, and compliance

36. Do we need malware scanning (rare for images but still possible) and/or file type validation?
37. Do we need NSFW / policy moderation, and what’s the workflow (auto + human review)?
38. Rate limits / spam prevention (bots uploading millions)?
39. DMCA/takedown flow, user reports, and legal requirements?
40. Privacy: must we strip EXIF GPS data by default?

## I. Data model & product extras

41. Do we need comments/likes (social features) or strictly storage?
42. Do we need versioning (replace image but keep old versions)?
43. Delete semantics: soft delete (trash) vs hard delete; retention window?
44. Billing/quotas: per-user storage limits, paid tiers?
45. Observability requirements: what metrics matter most (CDN hit rate, p95 transform time, upload fail rate)?
