Anytime you see scaling question, keep the 3 W's in mind:
What do we scale?
Where do we scale?
When do we scale?

What makes a template? What goes into a launch template?
AMI, EC2, instance size, security groups and potentially networking information

Launch template. The most up-to-date and flexible way to create a template.

Launch configurations. The older version. It's not "wrong" to use them, but if
possible, use templates.

User data is included in the template configuration.

Change. Can be versioned. Configurations are immutable.

Networking. Configurations don't include networking information. Templates could.
Auto scaling groups will contain the location of where your instances will live

Auto scaling is vital to creating a highly available application.
Remember to select answers that spread resources out over multiple AZs and
utilize load balances.

ELB. It's vital to select a load balancer for the instances to live behind.

Limits. Min, max and desired are the 3 important settings.

Notifications. SNS can act as a notification tool.

Balancing. Auto scaling will balance your EC2 instances across the AZ.

Scaling types:
    - Reactive Scaling. You are playing catchup. Once yhe load is there, you
    measure it and then determine if you need to create more resources
    - Scheduled Scaling. If you have a predictable workload, create a scaling
    event to get your resources ready to go before they're actually needed
    - Predictive Scaling. AWS uses its machine learning algorithms to determine
    when you will need to scale. They are reevaluated every 24 hours to create
    a forecast for the next 40.

Auto Scaling Policies:
 - Scale out aggressively. Get ahead of the workload if you need to.
 - Scale in conservatively. Once the instances are up, slowly roll them
 back when not needed.
 - Provisioning. Keep an eye an provisioning times. Bake those AMIs to minimize it.
 - Cost. Use EC2 Ris for minimum count of EC2 instances to save money.
 - CloudWatch. Your go-to tool for alerting Auto Scaling that you need more or less instances.
