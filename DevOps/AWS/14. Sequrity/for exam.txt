DDoS:
A Distributed Denial of Service attack attempts to make your website
or application unavailable to your end users

Common DDoS attacks include layer 4 attacks suck as SYN floods or NTP amplification attacks.

Common layer 7 attacks include floods of GET/POST requests

================================== CloudTrail ===============================
AWS CloudTrail is a service that enables governance, compliance, operational
auditing, and risk auditing of your AWS account.
Logging API calls.
It allows After-the-fact incident investigation.
Near real-time intrusion.
Industry and regulatory compliance.

CloudTrail is just CCTV for your AWS account. It logs all API calls made to
your AWS account and stores these logs in S3

================================== Shield ===============================
Shield protects against Layer 3 and Layer 4 only.
Shield is high level and is used to protect against DDoS. If you see a scenario
about DDoS mitigation or protection against Layers 3 and 4, think about Shield.
Advanced costs 3000 USD but give you 24/7 DDoS response team.

================================== AWS WAF ===============================
For filtering traffic.
WAF operates layer 7. If you see scenario about layer 7, think about WAF.

================================== GuardDuty ===============================
Intelligent threat detection.
Guarding your network. It uses AI to learn what normal behavior looks like in
your account and to alert you of any abnormal or malicious behaviour.

Updates a database of malicious domains using external feed from third parties.

Monitors CloudTrail logs, VPC Flow lLogs and DNS logs.

Finding appear in the GuardDuty Dashboard. CloudWatch events can be used to trigger
a Lambda function to address a threat

================================== AWS Firewall Manager ===============================
See a scenario about multiple AWS accounts and resources that need to be
secures centrally, think about AWS Firewall Manager.

================================== Macie ===============================
Macie uses AI to analyze data in S3 and helps identify PII, PHI and financial data.
Great for HIPAA and GDPR compliance as well as preventing identity.
Macie alerts can be sent to EventBridge.
Automate remediation actions using other AWS services as Step Functions.

================================== Inspector ===============================
It is used to perform vulnerability scans on both EC2 instances and VPCs.


================================== KMS and CloudHSM ===============================
KMS - Key Management Service.
If you need to secure your encryption keys in a service backed by FIPS-validated
HSMs, but you do not need to manage the HSM, you can try KMS.
7 days is the minimum length of time before you can schedule a KMS key to be deleted.
It makes it easy to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data.
 - Shared tenancy of underlying hardware
 - Automatic key rotation
 - Automatic key generation

CloudHSM
 - Dedicated HSM (hardware security modules) to you
 - Full control of underlying hardware
 - Full control of users, groups, keys, etc
 - No automatic key rotation

3 ways to generate a CMK:
1) AWS creates the CMK for you. The key material for a CMK is generated
within HSMs managed by AWS KMS
2) Import key material from your own key management infrastructure
3) Have the key material generated and used in an AWS CloudHSM cluster

================================== Secrets Manager ===============================
 - Secrets Manager can be used to securely store your application secrets:
database credentials, API keys, SSH keys, passwords, etc.
 - Applications use Secrets Manager API
 - Rotating credentials is super easy, but be careful
 - When enabled, Secrets Manager will rotate credentials immediately
 - Make sure all your application instances are configured to use Secrets Manager
 before enabling credentials rotation

If you need more than 10 000 parameters, key rotation, or the ability to generate
password using CloudFormation, use Secrets Manager.

================================== Parameter Store ===============================
Parameter Store or Secrets Manager? If you are trying to minimize cost, choose Parameter Store.

================================== Presigned URLs ===============================
For sharing private files in S3 buckets

================================== Advanced IAM Policy Documents ===============================
 - Not explicitly allowed == implicitly denied
 - Explicitly deny > everything else
 - Only attached policies have effect
 - AWS joins all applicable policies

================================== Certificate Manager ===============================
AWS Certificate Manager is used to create and store SSL certificates,
not certification certificates.
If you see scenarios around SSL certificates and what service you should use
to integrate SSL, choose Certificate Manager

Certificate Manager is integrated with Elastic Load Balancing, CloudFront and API Gateway.

Benefits. Certificate Manager is free. It automatically renews your SSL certificates
and rotate the old certificates with new

================================== AWS Audit Manager ===============================
If you have a scenario question about HIPAA or GDPR compliance that asks
about continuous auditing or automating auditing reports, choose Audit Manager

================================== AWS Artifact ===============================
If you see scenario question about audits and the need for compliance reports,
think about AWS Artifact.

================================== Amazon Cognito ===============================
Amazon Cognito provides authentication, authorization, and user management
for your web and mobile apps in a single service without the need for custom code.
The main role of AWS Cognito is to serve as a Customer Identity and Access
Management solution.
 - User pool: User directories that provide sign-up and sign-in options for users
of your application
 - Identity pool: Allows your users to access other AWS services
 - You can use User pool and Identity pool separately or together

================================== Amazon Detective ===============================
Amazon Detective operates across multiple AWS services and analyzes the root
cause of an event.

Do not confuse this with Inspector, which is an automated vulnerability
management service that continually scans EC2 and container workloads for software
vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure.

================================== AWS Network Firewall ===============================
If you see a scenario question about filtering your network traffic before
it reaches your internet gateway, or if you require intrusion prevention systems
or any hardware firewall requirements, think about AWS Network Firewall

================================== AWS Security Hub ===============================
If you have a scenario question about a single place to view all your security alerts across
multiple AWS security services and accounts, think about AWS Security Hub
AWS Security Hub is the most suitable service to meet your requirement for a
Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) solution that performs security best practice
checks, aggregates alerts, and enables automated remediation.
