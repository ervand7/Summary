ðŸ”‘ **Processor Cache** is a small, high-speed memory built into or near the
CPU that stores frequently used data and instructions to speed up processing.

âœ… **Purpose:**
* Reduces the time the CPU spends accessing slower main memory (RAM).
* Works on the **locality principle**: recently used data is likely to be used again.

âœ… **Cache Levels:**
1. **L1 Cache:** Smallest, fastest, inside each CPU core (instructions + data).
2. **L2 Cache:** Larger, slightly slower, often per core or shared.
3. **L3 Cache:** Largest, shared by all cores, reduces access bottlenecks.

âœ… **How it works:**
* **Cache hit:** Data found â†’ fast access.
* **Cache miss:** Data fetched from RAM â†’ slower.

ðŸ‘‰ Cache improves CPU speed, reduces latency, and boosts overall system performance.
