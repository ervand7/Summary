Partitioning enables horizontal scalability by allowing parallel
reads and writes, but ordering is guaranteed only within a single partition,
not across partitions.


Each partition can be processed independently.
More partitions → more parallelism and higher throughput.
However, once data is spread across partitions, Kafka cannot preserve a
global order.


### Key points interviewers expect
* One partition → one consumer per group
* Partitions are the unit of parallelism
* Same key → same partition → preserved order
* More partitions = better scalability, weaker ordering guarantees


### Trade-off to state clearly
> Kafka trades global ordering for scalability.

### One-liner to remember
> Partitions scale Kafka, but ordering lives inside a partition.
