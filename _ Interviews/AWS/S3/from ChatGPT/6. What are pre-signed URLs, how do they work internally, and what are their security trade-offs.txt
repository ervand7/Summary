What they are:
Pre-signed URLs are time-limited URLs that let a client upload or download an S3 object
without AWS credentials.

How they work internally:

* Generated by a trusted backend using AWS credentials
* URL contains:

  * object key + operation (GET/PUT)
  * expiration time
  * cryptographic signature (AWS SigV4)
* S3 verifies the signature and expiry on every request

Security trade-offs:

* ✅ No credentials exposed to the client
* ⚠️ Anyone with the URL can use it until it expires
* ⚠️ Cannot be revoked early (only by key deletion or bucket policy)
* ⚠️ Must use short expirations and HTTPS

Key takeaway:

> Pre-signed URLs shift trust to time limits — safe when short-lived and tightly scoped,
risky if leaked or long-lived.
