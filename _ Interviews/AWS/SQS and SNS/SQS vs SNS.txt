### Core difference (one sentence)

* SNS → *broadcast a message*
* SQS → *store a task until someone processes it*

---

### Think in real life

#### 📣 SNS = loudspeaker

> “Order created!”

* Everyone listening hears it
* Same message goes to many receivers
* No storage

#### 📦 SQS = mailbox

> “Process this order”

* Message waits until one worker picks it up
* If worker crashes → message comes back
* Reliable task execution

### Side-by-side (short)

|                | SNS      | SQS        |
| -------------- | -------- | ---------- |
| Model          | Pub/Sub  | Queue      |
| Delivery       | Push     | Pull       |
| Consumers      | Many     | One        |
| Message stored | ❌ No    | ✅ Yes     |
| Use case       | Events   | Jobs/tasks |

### Common AWS pattern (important 💡)

```
Producer
   |
   v
  SNS
   |
   v
  SQS
   |
   v
 Lambda workers
```

Why?

* SNS → fan-out
* SQS → reliability + retries
