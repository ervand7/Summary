RabbitMQ stores messages until they are consumed or expire.
There is no time-based retention by default.

Details (still short):

* Message is removed when acknowledged by a consumer
* You *can* configure expiration:

  * TTL on a queue → all messages expire after N ms
  * TTL per message → message expires after N ms
* Expired messages are dropped or dead-lettered

One-line interview answer:

> RabbitMQ keeps messages until they’re consumed, unless TTL or max-length policies
delete them earlier.
