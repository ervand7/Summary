> A generator is a function that returns values one at a time using `yield`, producing
a lazy iterator instead of computing everything at once.

---

### Minimal example

```python
def numbers():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3
```

```python
for n in numbers():
    print(n)
```

### Why generators matter

* Lazy → values produced only when needed
* Memory-efficient → no full list in memory
* Perfect for streams, files, large data

---

### Key facts (must know)

* `yield` pauses the function
* Execution resumes from last `yield`
* Generator keeps its state automatically
* Used once (exhausted after iteration)

---

### Common real use

```python
def read_lines(path):
    with open(path) as f:
        for line in f:
            yield line
```

### One-liner for interview

> “Generators allow me to iterate over large or infinite sequences efficiently by
producing values lazily with `yield`.”


It has functions `send`, `throw`, `close`
