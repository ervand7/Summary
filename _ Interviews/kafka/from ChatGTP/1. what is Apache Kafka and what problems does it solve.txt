Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform** used to reliably publish,
store, and consume events at scale.
It solves problems of asynchronous communication, service decoupling, high throughput,
fault tolerance, and event replay.


### One-sentence explanation
Kafka acts as a durable, ordered, append-only log that allows many producers and
consumers to exchange data independently and at high scale.


### Key problems it solves (very short)
* Decouples microservices
* Handles very high throughput
* Guarantees ordering (per partition)
* Prevents message loss with replication
* Allows replay and reprocessing of events


### Strong one-liner to remember
> Kafka is a distributed commit log for event-driven systems.
