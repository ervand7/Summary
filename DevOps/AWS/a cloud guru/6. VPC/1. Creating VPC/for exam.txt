 - VPC is a logical data center in AWS

 - Consists of gateways (or virtual private gateways), route tables, network
 access control lists, subnets, and security groups

 - 1 subnet is always in 1 AZ

 What we can do with VPC?
 - Launch instances into a subnet of your choosing
 - Assign custom IP addresses ranges in each subnet
 - Configure route tables between subnets
 - Create internet gateway and attach it to our VPC
 - Mach better security control over your AWS resources
 - Subnet network access lists
 - You can use network access control lists (NACLs) to clock specific IP addresses
