Rate limiting controls how many requests a client can make.

Why:
* Prevent abuse and DoS
* Protect backend resources
* Ensure fair usage

Where it should live:
* API Gateway / Load Balancer (preferred)
* Reverse proxy (NGINX)
* Application layer (fallback)
* Distributed store (Redis) for consistency

Key idea:
> Rate limit as early as possible in the request path
