Refactor when code slows you down or becomes risky.

Signals:
* Hard to understand or change
* Frequent bugs in same area
* Duplication grows
* Performance issues
* New features become painful

Rules:
* Refactor with tests in place
* Do it incrementally
* Avoid “big rewrite” without need

Key idea:
> Refactor to reduce future cost, not for beauty
