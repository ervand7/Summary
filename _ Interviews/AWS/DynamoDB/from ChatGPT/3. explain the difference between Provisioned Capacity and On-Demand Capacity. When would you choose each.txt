Provisioned vs On-Demand capacity in DynamoDB

Provisioned Capacity:

* You specify RCUs and WCUs
* Cheaper for predictable, steady workloads
* Supports auto-scaling within min/max limits
* Risk of throttling if capacity is underestimated
* Requires capacity planning

On-Demand Capacity:

* No capacity planning required
* DynamoDB automatically handles traffic spikes
* Scales instantly with workload
* More expensive per request
* Best for unpredictable or spiky traffic

When to choose each

Choose Provisioned when:

* Traffic pattern is stable or predictable
* Cost optimization is important
* You can forecast load reasonably well

Choose On-Demand when:

* Traffic is unknown, spiky, or bursty
* You want zero operational overhead
* Workload is new or experimental

Interview one-liner:

> Provisioned capacity is cheaper but requires planning, while On-Demand trades
higher cost for instant scaling and zero capacity management, making it ideal
for unpredictable workloads.
