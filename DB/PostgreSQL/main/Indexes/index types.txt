A database index is not typically implemented as a binary tree. While
it can vary depending on the database management system (DBMS) and the
specific type of index, many modern DBMSs use B-tree (balanced tree)
structures for their default indexes.

Here's a brief overview:

1. **B-tree (Balanced Tree):** The B-tree is a self-balancing tree structure
that maintains sorted data and allows for efficient insertion, deletion,
and search operations. It's commonly used for database indexes because of
its balance and ability to maintain a relatively uniform height as data grows.

2. **Hash Index:** Some databases use a hash index, which employs a
hash function to map keys (column values) to locations where data is stored.
 While hash indexes can be very fast for exact match queries, they may not
 perform as well for range queries.

3. **Bitmap Index:** Bitmap indexes use bitmaps (a series of bits) to represent
sets of values for each indexed column. They are efficient for low cardinality
columns (columns with few distinct values) but can be memory-intensive for high
cardinality columns.

4. **GiST and GIN Indexes:** These are specialized index types in PostgreSQL.
GiST (Generalized Search Tree) and GIN (Generalized Inverted Index) indexes are
designed for complex data types like arrays and full-text search.

5. **Spatial Index:** In databases that support spatial data types, spatial
indexes like R-tree (Rectangular Tree) are used to optimize spatial queries.

The choice of index type depends on the DBMS and the specific requirements of
the queries you'll be running. B-tree indexes are versatile and widely used,
but other types can be more suitable for specific use cases, such as full-text
search or spatial data queries. The goal is to select an index type that
optimizes the most common query patterns in your application.
