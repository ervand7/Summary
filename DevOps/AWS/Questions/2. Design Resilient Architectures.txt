A financial tech company has decided to begin migrating their applications
to the AWS cloud. Currently, they host their entire application using several
self-managed Kubernetes clusters. One of their major concerns during this
migration is monitoring and collecting system metrics due to the very
large-scale deployments that are in place. Your Chief Technology Officer
has requested the use of open-source technologies for this implementation
but has also stipulated that, with the current workload of the team,
the ability to manage the monitoring environment needs to be low-maintenance.
Which combination of the following AWS services would best fit the company
requirements while minimizing operational overhead?
 - AWS Managed Grafana
 - AWS Managed Service for Prometheus


Due to strict compliance requirements, your company cannot leverage AWS cloud for
hosting their Kubernetes clusters, nor for managing the clusters. However, they
do want to try to follow the established best practices and processes that the
Amazon EKS service has implemented. How can your company achieve this while
running entirely on-premises?
 - Run the clusters on-premises using Amazon EKS Distro
