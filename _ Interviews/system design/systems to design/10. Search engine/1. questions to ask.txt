### A. Scope (what exactly are we building?)

1. Is this a web search engine (like Google) or site/app search (search inside one product)?
2. Do we need full crawling of the public web, or do documents come from partners / user submissions?
3. Which content types are in scope: HTML only, or also PDF/DOC, images, video?
4. Do we support multiple languages? Any special tokenization needs (CJK, Cyrillic, etc.)?
5. Is this general search or a vertical (news, e-commerce, jobs)?

### B. Must-have features (MVP)

6. What is the expected UX: 10 blue links, or also snippets, sitelinks, knowledge panels?
7. Do we need autocomplete / suggestions?
8. Do we need “Did you mean” spell correction?
9. Do we support advanced operators (site:, filetype:, time range, quotes)?
10. Do we need safe search / adult content filtering?

### C. Scale & latency targets

11. Corpus size: how many documents/pages? (10M, 1B?)
12. Query QPS peak? (and geographic distribution)
13. Latency target: p95 and p99 for search results (e.g., p95 < 200 ms)?
14. Freshness: how quickly must updates appear in results? (seconds / minutes / hours)
15. Multi-region requirement: active-active global, or single region?

### D. Crawling strategy (if web search)

16. Are we allowed to crawl everything, or must follow strict policies (robots.txt, per-domain quotas)?
17. Crawl frequency: recrawl popular pages often? How to handle news / trending?
18. How to discover URLs: seed list only, or link extraction + sitemaps?
19. How to handle duplicate pages and near-duplicates?
20. Any legal/compliance constraints on storage (GDPR “right to be forgotten”)?

### E. Ranking & relevance (the hard part)

21. Ranking goal: “good enough” (BM25 + signals) or ML ranking (learning-to-rank)?
22. Personalization needed (location, language, user history) or anonymous only?
23. Do we need to handle recency boosting (fresh results for news queries)?
24. Spam resistance requirements (link farms, keyword stuffing)?
25. Do we need ads (sponsored results) and how separated from organic?

### F. Indexing details

26. Do we index full text, or only title + headings + anchors?
27. Do we store positions for phrase search and highlighting?
28. Do we need faceting/filters (date, domain, language)?
29. Storage constraints: can we keep a cached copy of the page (for snippets),
or only metadata?
30. Consistency model: is it ok if some shards are briefly stale?

### G. Safety, abuse, and quality

31. Rate limiting / bot protection for the search API?
32. Content moderation rules (adult, violence, hate, malware)?
33. Malware/phishing detection required in results?
34. “Remove results” workflow (DMCA, takedowns)?
35. Audit logs and explainability required?

### H. Observability & ops

36. What metrics matter most: p95 latency, CTR, “no results” rate, freshness
lag, crawl errors?
37. On-call constraints: must degrade gracefully if a shard is down?
38. Backfill/reindex requirements (schema changes)?
39. Cost constraints: “cheapest possible” vs “best quality”?
40. Offline evaluation: do we have labeled data / relevance judgments?
