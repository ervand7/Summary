👉 These three describe different dimensions of system performance.

Latency
* Time it takes to process one request
* Measured in milliseconds (p50 / p95 / p99)
* Affects user experience directly

Throughput
* How many requests the system completes per second
* Measured as RPS
* Indicates overall processing capacity

Concurrency
* Number of requests being processed at the same time
* Depends on both throughput and latency

Key relationship (very important):
```
Concurrency ≈ Throughput × Latency
```

Why this matters:
* Throughput can stay constant while latency grows
* Higher latency increases concurrency
* High concurrency increases memory, goroutine, and pool pressure

Common mistake:
* Confusing high throughput with good latency
* A system can handle high RPS but still be slow or unstable

One-line interview answer:
> Latency is how long one request takes, throughput is how many requests are handled
per second, and concurrency is how many requests are in-flight at once, roughly equal
to throughput multiplied by latency.
