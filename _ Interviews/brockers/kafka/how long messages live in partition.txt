👉 Messages live in a partition as long as the retention policy allows.

* Retention is usually time-based (e.g. 7 days)
* Or size-based (e.g. keep last 100 GB)
* Messages are deleted regardless of whether they were consumed or not
* Consumers keep only offsets, not the messages themselves

Typical interview phrase:
> Kafka stores messages based on retention policies, not on consumption state.
