To query time-series data efficiently in PostgreSQL, you optimize for 
append-heavy writes and time-based reads.

Key techniques:

* Index on timestamp (often composite: `(time, id)`)
* Partition tables by time (daily / monthly)
* Use BRIN indexes for large, ordered tables
* Avoid updates; prefer append-only
* Query by time ranges, not full scans

Example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM events
WHERE created_at >= now() - interval '1 day';
```

One-liner (interview-ready):

> Efficient time-series queries rely on time-based partitioning, proper indexes,
and append-only patterns.
