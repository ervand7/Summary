CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) tricks a user’s browser into making
an unwanted authenticated request.

How it works:
* User is logged in
* Malicious site sends a request using user’s cookies
* Server thinks it’s a legitimate action

Prevention:
* CSRF tokens (most important)
* SameSite cookies
* Check Origin / Referer headers
* Use POST for state-changing actions

Key idea:
> Verify the request really comes from your site
