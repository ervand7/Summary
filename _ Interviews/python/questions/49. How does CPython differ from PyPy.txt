CPython:
* Default Python implementation
* Interprets bytecode
* Reference counting + GC
* Best compatibility with C extensions

PyPy:
* Alternative implementation
* Has a JIT compiler (often faster for CPU-bound code)
* Different GC (not refcount-based)
* Some C extensions may be slower or incompatible

Key idea:
> CPython = compatibility, PyPy = JIT speed (when it fits)
