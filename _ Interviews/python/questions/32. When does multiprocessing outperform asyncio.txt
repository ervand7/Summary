Multiprocessing outperforms asyncio for CPU-bound work.

Why:
* Each process has its own GIL
* Runs truly in parallel on multiple cores
* Asyncio is single-threaded and cooperative

Examples:
* Heavy computation
* Data processing
* Image / video processing
* ML preprocessing

Rule of thumb:
> asyncio for I/O, multiprocessing for CPU
