```
Partition Key = customer_id
```

**Worst-case access pattern:**

* One customer becomes a VIP
* Generates 100k writes/reads per minute
* All traffic hits **one partition key**
  → **hot partition + throttling**

**Safer design:**

```
PK = order_id (UUID)
GSI = customer_id + created_at
```

Writes stay evenly distributed even in the worst case.
