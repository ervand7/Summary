In the context of blockchain technology, **hard forks** and **soft forks** are two
types of changes or upgrades to the blockchain protocol. Both forks involve altering
the rules or structure of the blockchain, but they have different implications and
outcomes.

### Hard Fork:
- **Definition**: A hard fork is a radical change to the blockchain protocol that
makes previously invalid blocks or transactions valid (or vice versa). It requires all
nodes or users to upgrade to the latest version of the protocol software.
- **Result**: A hard fork can result in a split of the blockchain into two separate
chains if not all participants in the network agree to adopt the new rules. Each chain
will then have its own version of the history and its own tokens.
- **Examples**:
  - **Bitcoin Cash (BCH)** was created from a hard fork of Bitcoin (BTC) in 2017 due to
  disagreements over how to scale the network.
  - **Ethereum Classic (ETC)** was created from a hard fork of Ethereum (ETH) after the
  DAO hack in 2016.

### Soft Fork:
- **Definition**: A soft fork is a backward-compatible upgrade to the blockchain
protocol. This means that the new rules are compatible with the old protocol, so
non-upgraded nodes can still validate transactions, as long as those transactions
follow the new rules.
- **Result**: Since it is backward-compatible, a soft fork typically does not lead to a
chain split. The blockchain continues on a single chain, and the updated protocol
becomes the new consensus.
- **Examples**:
  - **Segregated Witness (SegWit)** in Bitcoin is an example of a soft fork. It was
  implemented to fix transaction malleability and increase the block size limit.

### Key Differences:
- **Compatibility**: Hard forks are not backward-compatible, whereas soft forks are.
- **Outcome**: Hard forks can lead to a split in the blockchain, resulting in two
separate chains, while soft forks do not split the chain and maintain a single chain.
- **Adoption**: Hard forks require all participants to upgrade to the new software,
while soft forks allow nodes that haven't upgraded to continue participating in the
network, as long as they follow the new rules.

In summary, hard forks lead to permanent divergence in the blockchain, potentially
creating a new cryptocurrency, while soft forks introduce changes that are
backward-compatible and don't split the chain.
