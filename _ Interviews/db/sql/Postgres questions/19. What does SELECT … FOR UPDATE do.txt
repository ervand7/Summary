`SELECT … FOR UPDATE` locks the selected rows for writing.

What it does:

* Acquires row-level exclusive locks
* Prevents other transactions from:

  * updating those rows
  * deleting those rows
  * locking them with `FOR UPDATE`

What it does NOT do:

* Does not block normal `SELECT` queries

Why it’s used:

* Safe read-modify-write logic
* Prevents race conditions

Example use case:

```sql
BEGIN;
SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE id = 1 FOR UPDATE;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
COMMIT;
```

One-liner (interview-ready):

> `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` locks rows so only one transaction can modify them at a time.
