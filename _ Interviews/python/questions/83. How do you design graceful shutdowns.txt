Graceful shutdown lets a service stop without breaking in-flight work.

How to design:
* Catch termination signals (SIGTERM)
* Stop accepting new requests
* Finish in-flight requests
* Close connections cleanly
* Enforce a timeout before force exit

Key idea:
> Stop accepting, finish working, then exit
