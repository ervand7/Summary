Multi-AZ vs Read Replica

Multi-AZ:
    - An exact copy of your production database in another AZ
    - Used for disaster recovery
    - In the event of a failure, RDS will automatically fail over to the standby instance

Read Replica:
    - A read-only copy of your primary database in the same AZ, cross-AZ, or cross-region
    - Used to increase or scale read performance
    - Great for read-heavy workloads and takes the load off your primary database
    for read-only workloads (e.g. business intelligence reporting jobs)
