You avoid N+1 queries by fetching related data in bulk, not per row.

Common solutions:

* Use JOINs instead of per-row queries
* Fetch related rows with `IN (...)`
* Preload / batch queries
* Cache frequently accessed data

Example (bad → good):

```text
❌ 1 query for users + N queries for orders
✅ 1 JOIN query or 2 batched queries
```

Key idea:

> Always think in sets, not rows.

One-liner (interview-ready):

> N+1 queries are avoided by batching and joining related data instead of querying per row.
