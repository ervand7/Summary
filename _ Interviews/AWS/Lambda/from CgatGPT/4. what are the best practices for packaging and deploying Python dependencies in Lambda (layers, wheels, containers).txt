Goal: small, fast, reproducible Lambda deployments.

* Use wheels built for Amazon Linux
* Keep function ZIP minimal (handler + app code)
* Use Lambda Layers for shared dependencies
* Don’t bundle boto3 or dev deps
* Use containers only for heavy native deps or OS control

One-liner:

> I package Python deps as Amazon-Linux wheels, keep the ZIP slim, use layers for
shared libs, and switch to Lambda container images only for heavy native dependencies.
