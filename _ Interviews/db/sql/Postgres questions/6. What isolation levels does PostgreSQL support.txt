PostgreSQL supports 3 isolation levels (even though SQL defines 4):

* READ COMMITTED *(default)*
* REPEATABLE READ
* SERIALIZABLE

Key detail interviewers love:
* PostgreSQL does NOT implement READ UNCOMMITTED
* `READ UNCOMMITTED` behaves the same as `READ COMMITTED`

Quick meaning:

* READ COMMITTED → each query sees latest committed data
* REPEATABLE READ → same snapshot for whole transaction
* SERIALIZABLE → full isolation using predicate locking
