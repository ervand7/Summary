👉 A stateless service does not store user-specific or request-specific state
in its own memory between requests.

Each request:

* Is independent
* Can be handled by any instance
* Carries all required context (token, IDs, data)


### Why this is critical for load balancing

1. Any request → any instance
* Load balancer can freely route traffic
* No need to “remember” where a user was before

2. No sticky sessions
* Instances can be added or removed safely
* Crashes don’t lose user state

3. Easy horizontal scaling
* Add 1 → add 100 instances
* No rebalancing of in-memory data

4. Better fault tolerance
* If an instance dies, nothing is lost
* Requests are retried on another instance


### What breaks statelessness
* In-memory sessions
* Local caches tied to users
* Request affinity requirements


### One-liner interview answer
> A stateless service keeps no per-user state in memory, allowing any request to be
handled by any instance, which is essential for effective load balancing and scaling.
