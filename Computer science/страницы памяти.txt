In operating systems, **memory pages** are fixed-size blocks of memory (usually 4 KB
to 64 KB) used to manage and organize virtual memory. They allow each process to have
an isolated, protected memory space.

### Key Points of Memory Pages:
1. **Virtual Memory Management**: Pages enable virtual memory by mapping each process’s
virtual address space to physical memory, allowing isolation between processes.

2. **Efficient Memory Use**: Only actively used pages remain in RAM; inactive pages
can be swapped to disk, optimizing memory usage.

3. **Page Tables and Translation**: Each process has a **page table** mapping virtual
addresses to physical addresses. A **page fault** occurs if a requested page isn’t
in memory, triggering the OS to load it from disk.

4. **Copy-on-Write (COW)**: With `fork()`, pages are shared between parent and child
processes in read-only mode. Only when changes are made does the OS copy the page,
saving memory.

Memory paging supports multitasking, memory protection, and efficient use of limited
physical RAM in an OS.
