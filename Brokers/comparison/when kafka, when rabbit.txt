Choose **Kafka** when you need high throughput, fault tolerance, and persistent
storage for real-time data streams and analytics. It excels in handling large volumes
of sequential data with replay capability and is ideal for distributed log processing,
event sourcing, and stream processing.

Choose **RabbitMQ** for reliable message delivery in systems with complex routing
requirements, particularly where you need guaranteed delivery with lower latency. Itâ€™s
well-suited for task queues, real-time communication, and applications with sophisticated
routing and flexible acknowledgment controls.
