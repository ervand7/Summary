A connection pool is a set of reusable database connections to avoid opening
a new connection per request.

Why it matters:

* Opening DB connections is expensive
* Pools reduce latency and DB overload

How to tune in Go (`database/sql`):

* `SetMaxOpenConns` → max total connections
* `SetMaxIdleConns` → idle connections kept
* `SetConnMaxLifetime` → recycle connections

Rule of thumb:

> Pool size ≈ DB max connections ÷ number of app instances.

One-liner (interview-ready):

> A connection pool reuses DB connections; tuning balances throughput without
exhausting the database.
