# Implementing a B-tree is a complex task, and a complete implementation
# would involve handling various operations like insertion, deletion, and
# search while maintaining the B-tree properties. Below is a simplified
# example of a B-tree in Python. This example focuses on the structure of a
# B-tree node and a basic insertion operation. It doesn't include error handling
# or other necessary features for a full-fledged B-tree.


class BTreeNode:
    def __init__(self, leaf=True):
        self.keys = []
        self.children = []
        self.leaf = leaf


class BTree:
    def __init__(self, t):
        self.root = BTreeNode()
        self.t = t  # the minimum number of keys required in a non-root node

    def insert(self, key):
        root = self.root
        if len(root.keys) == (2 * self.t) - 1:
            new_node = BTreeNode()
            self.root = new_node
            new_node.children.append(root)
            self._split(new_node, 0)
            self._insert_non_full(new_node, key)
        else:
            self._insert_non_full(root, key)

    def _insert_non_full(self, x, key):
        i = len(x.keys) - 1
        if x.leaf:
            x.keys.append(None)
            while i >= 0 and key < x.keys[i]:
                x.keys[i + 1] = x.keys[i]
                i -= 1
            x.keys[i + 1] = key
        else:
            while i >= 0 and key < x.keys[i]:
                i -= 1
            i += 1
            if len(x.children[i].keys) == (2 * self.t) - 1:
                self._split(x, i)
                if key > x.keys[i]:
                    i += 1
            self._insert_non_full(x.children[i], key)

    def _split(self, x, i):
        t = self.t
        y = x.children[i]
        z = BTreeNode(leaf=y.leaf)
        x.children.insert(i + 1, z)
        x.keys.insert(i, y.keys[t - 1])
        z.keys = y.keys[t:]
        y.keys = y.keys[:t - 1]
        if not y.leaf:
            z.children = y.children[t:]
            y.children = y.children[:t]

# This is a simplified example, and a full implementation would involve additional
# functionalities such as deletion and search operations, as well as proper error
# handling. The `t` parameter in the `BTree` class represents the minimum degree
# of the B-tree, and it determines the maximum number of children a node can have.
