PostgreSQL is an open-source, enterprise-grade relational database focused on
correctness, standards compliance, and advanced features.

Difference from MySQL:

* PostgreSQL → richer SQL support (CTEs, window functions, JSONB, full MVCC), strong
 consistency, complex queries
* MySQL → simpler, faster to start with, often used for basic CRUD and read-heavy workloads

One-liner:
> PostgreSQL prioritizes features and correctness, MySQL prioritizes simplicity and speed.
