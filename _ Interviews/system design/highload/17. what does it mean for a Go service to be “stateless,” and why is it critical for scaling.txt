 A stateless Go service keeps no per-user state in memory, allowing any instance to 
handle any request, which makes horizontal scaling, load balancing, and fault tolerance 
simple and reliable.

In contrast, a stateful service keeps user/session state in memory, which requires
sticky sessions or external state storage and complicates scaling, failover, and
instance restarts.
