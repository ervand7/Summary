### Product / scope

* What’s the main goal: just redirect, or also analytics (clicks, geo, referrer, device)?
* Do we need custom aliases (e.g., `mybrand/hello`)?
* Do we need link expiration / TTL? Can users edit/delete links?
* Public service or authenticated users only? Any API keys?
* Do we need user-owned namespaces / teams / orgs?


### Traffic / scale (numbers drive architecture)

* Expected writes (new short URLs) per second? Peak?
* Expected reads (redirects) per second? Peak?
* Expected total URLs stored (10M? 1B?) and growth rate?
* Expected read/write ratio? (Typically reads >> writes)
* Latency targets for redirect (p50/p99)? (e.g., p99 < 50–100ms)
* Availability target (99.9 / 99.99)?


### Redirect behavior

* Must be 301 (permanent) or 302 (temporary) by default?
* Should we support UTM passthrough and keep query params?
* Do we need preview page / malware warning / safe browsing checks?


### Security / abuse

* Should we block/limit spam, phishing, malware?
* Rate limiting requirements per IP/user?
* Are links private (only accessible with auth) or always public?


### Data correctness & consistency

* Is it acceptable that a newly created link may not work for a few seconds (eventual consistency)?
* Must custom aliases be strictly unique globally?


### Multi-region / deployment

* Single region or multi-region?
* Any constraints: cloud provider, using managed DB/Redis/Kafka, etc.?
