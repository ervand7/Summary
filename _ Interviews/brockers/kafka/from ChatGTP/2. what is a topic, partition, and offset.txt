* Topic – a logical stream of messages (events) of the same type
* Partition – an ordered, append-only log within a topic that enables scalability
* Offset – a sequential number identifying a message’s position inside a partition


A topic is divided into partitions so Kafka can scale horizontally.
Each partition preserves message order, and every message inside a partition
has a unique offset, which consumers use to track progress.


* Ordering is guaranteed only within a partition
* Partitions allow parallel consumption
* Offsets are per-partition, not global
* Consumers store offsets, not Kafka pushing messages


### One-liner mental model
> Topic = stream, Partition = shard, Offset = position in the shard
