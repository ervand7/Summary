When you run an invariant test using the Foundry framework, the framework executes your
smart contract many times with different sequences of inputs, transactions, or operations.
The goal is to explore a wide range of possible states and actions to ensure that the specified
invariants hold true under all circumstances.

### Here's how it works:

1. **Randomized Input Generation**: Foundry generates random inputs and executes various transactions
on your contract. These inputs can be function arguments, sequences of function calls, or even
different state changes.

2. **Invariant Checking**: After performing a series of operations on your contract, Foundry checks
whether the invariants (the conditions you want to be true at all times) still hold. If an invariant
is violated at any point, the test fails.

3. **Multiple Runs**: The framework runs these tests many times (as specified by the `runs` parameter)
to cover a broad range of scenarios and inputs. This helps in uncovering edge cases or bugs that might
only occur under specific conditions.

4. **State Exploration**: By varying the depth and sequence of operations (`depth` parameter),
Foundry explores different contract states to ensure that your contract behaves correctly and
maintains its invariants across a wide spectrum of possible situations.

### Example:
If you have an invariant that ensures the contract remains overcollateralized, Foundry will perform
a wide range of operations, such as depositing collateral, minting tokens, and more, to check if the
contract ever becomes undercollateralized. If it does, the invariant test will fail, indicating a
potential issue in the contract logic.

This type of testing is particularly powerful for finding subtle bugs and ensuring that your smart
contract is robust and secure.
