Use multipart upload when:

* Uploading large objects (typically >100 MB, required >5 GB)
* You want parallel uploads for speed
* You need resume/retry without re-uploading everything

What it solves:

* Faster uploads (parts in parallel)
* Fault tolerance (retry only failed parts)
* Required for very large files (S3 limit)

Problems it introduces:

* More complexity (init, upload parts, complete/abort)
* Orphaned parts if uploads aren’t completed → extra cost
  (must clean up with lifecycle rules)
* Ordering and checksum handling must be managed carefully

Key takeaway:

> Multipart upload improves performance and reliability for big files, but needs
cleanup and careful completion logic.
