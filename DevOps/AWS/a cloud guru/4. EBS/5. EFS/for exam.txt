If you have a scenario-based question around highly scalable shared storage
using NFS - think EFS.
EFS automatically scales the volume size based on usage.
EFS is a file-level storage solution.

 - Supports the Network File System version 4 (NFSv4) protocol

 - Only pay for the storage you use (no pre-provisioning required)

 - Can scale up to petabytes

 - Can support thousands of concurrent NFS connections

 - Data is stored across multiple AZs within a region

 - Read-after-write consistency
