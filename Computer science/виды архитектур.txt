### ðŸ”‘ 1. **x86 Architecture (CISC)**
* Developed originally by **Intel**.
* Used in **most PCs, laptops, and servers**.
* Examples: Intel Core i3/i5/i7/i9, AMD Ryzen.
* Itâ€™s a **Complex Instruction Set Computing (CISC)** architectureâ€”rich instruction
set with many powerful instructions.


### ðŸ”‘ 2. **ARM Architecture (RISC)**
* Designed by **ARM Holdings**.
* Used in **smartphones, tablets, IoT devices, and now in Apple M1/M2/M3 Macs**.
* Examples: Qualcomm Snapdragon, Apple M1/M2, Raspberry Pi CPUs.
* Itâ€™s a **Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC)** architectureâ€”simpler, smaller,
and more energy-efficient instructions.
