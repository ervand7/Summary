Lag is the difference between the latest offset in a partition and the offset
a consumer has processed. It is measured as `log_end_offset − committed_offset` and
shows how far behind a consumer is.


Each partition has a high watermark (or end offset).
Kafka tracks the committed offset for each consumer group.
The gap between them is the consumer lag.


### Why lag is important
* Indicates processing speed vs input rate
* Early signal of performance problems
* Helps detect stuck or slow consumers
* Used for autoscaling decisions


### Common causes of lag
* Slow message processing
* Insufficient consumers
* Hot partitions
* Downstream dependencies (DB, API)
* Rebalancing events


### Key points interviewers expect
* Lag is per partition
* Zero lag ≠ system is healthy (processing might be slow but caught up)
* Growing lag = system is falling behind


### One-liner to remember
> Lag measures how far consumers are behind the log.
