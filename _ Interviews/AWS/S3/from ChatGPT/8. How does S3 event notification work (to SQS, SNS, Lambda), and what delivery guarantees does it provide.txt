* S3 emits events (e.g. `ObjectCreated`, `ObjectRemoved`)
* Events are filtered by prefix/suffix
* Delivered to:

  * Lambda (push, synchronous invocation)
  * SQS (queue)
  * SNS (topic → fan-out)

Delivery guarantees:

* At-least-once delivery (duplicates are possible)
* Best-effort ordering (no strict ordering guarantee)
* Events may arrive late or out of order
* Very rare drops can happen → do not rely on events as the sole source of truth

Best practices:

* Make consumers idempotent
* Use SQS + Lambda for retries and buffering
* Validate object existence when processing

Key takeaway:

> S3 events are notifications, not transactions—design consumers to tolerate duplicates
and delays.
