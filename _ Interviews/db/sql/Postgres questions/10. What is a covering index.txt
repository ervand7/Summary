A covering index is an index that contains all columns needed by a query, so
PostgreSQL doesn’t need to read the table itself.

Example:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_cover
ON orders (user_id)
INCLUDE (amount, status);
```

Query:

```sql
SELECT amount, status
FROM orders
WHERE user_id = 42;
```

👉 PostgreSQL can use an index-only scan.

Why it matters:

* Fewer disk reads
* Much faster queries

One-liner (interview-ready):

> A covering index lets PostgreSQL answer a query using only the index, without
touching the table.
