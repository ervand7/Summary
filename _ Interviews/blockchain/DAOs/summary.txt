A DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is a group or organization that operates based
on rules encoded in smart contracts, where decisions are made collectively by its members
through voting, without central leadership.

### Simple Example:
Imagine a club where members vote on how to spend the club's money (e.g., buying supplies).
In a DAO, the rules about how the money can be spent are written into a smart contract, and
every decision is voted on by members using tokens they hold. If the majority agrees, the
smart contract automatically executes the decision, like transferring funds to buy the supplies,
without needing a leader to manually approve it.

DAOs are common in the world of blockchain for managing projects, investments, or even
communities, giving power directly to participants.

Here are some well-known organizations that are structured as DAOs:
1. **MakerDAO**: MakerDAO governs the Maker Protocol, which issues the stablecoin DAI, a
decentralized stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. MakerDAO token holders vote on key decisions
about the system.

2. **Uniswap DAO**: Uniswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that allows users to trade
cryptocurrencies. The Uniswap DAO governs the platform, with UNI token holders voting on protocol
upgrades and changes.

3. **Aave**: Aave is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that offers crypto lending and
borrowing. Its DAO (Aave Governance) enables token holders to vote on decisions about the platform,
such as adding new assets or adjusting interest rates.
