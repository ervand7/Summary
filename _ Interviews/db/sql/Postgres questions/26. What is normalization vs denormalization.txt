* Normalization

  * Split data into multiple tables
  * Avoid duplication
  * Strong consistency
  * More joins

* Denormalization

  * Duplicate data deliberately
  * Fewer joins, faster reads
  * More complex writes
  * Risk of inconsistency

Rule of thumb:

> Normalize for correctness, denormalize for performance.

One-liner (interview-ready):

> Normalization reduces redundancy; denormalization trades consistency for faster reads.
