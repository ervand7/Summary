Avoid dataclasses when:
* Complex validation logic is needed
* Invariants must be strictly enforced
* Object lifecycle is non-trivial
* Heavy inheritance or dynamic attributes are required

Better fit:
* Regular classes
* Explicit __init__ and methods

Key idea:
> Dataclasses are for simple data holders
