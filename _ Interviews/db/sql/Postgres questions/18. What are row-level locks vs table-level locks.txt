* Row-level locks

  * Lock specific rows
  * Allow high concurrency
  * Used by `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `SELECT … FOR UPDATE`

* Table-level locks

  * Lock the entire table
  * Block concurrent operations
  * Used by `ALTER TABLE`, `TRUNCATE`, some DDL

One-liner (interview-ready):

> Row-level locks protect individual rows, table-level locks protect the whole
table and reduce concurrency.
