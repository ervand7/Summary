* SERIAL / BIGSERIAL

  * Auto-increment integers
  * Smaller, faster indexes
  * Good for single DB, centralized writes
  * Predictable IDs

* UUID

  * Globally unique
  * Safe for distributed systems, sharding, offline writes
  * No coordination needed
  * Larger indexes, slower than integers

Rule of thumb:

> Use SERIAL/BIGSERIAL for simple, single-DB systems; UUID for distributed or
multi-writer systems.

One-liner (interview-ready):

> SERIAL is faster and smaller; UUID is safer for distributed systems.
