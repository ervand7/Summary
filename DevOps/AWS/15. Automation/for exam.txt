Benefits. It is more reliable and faster.

================================== CloudFormation ===============================
CloudFormation is perfect for creating immutable infrastructure.
If it finds an error, CloudFormation rolls back based on your configuration.
Hard-coded values and resource IDs can be the reason templates fail to create.
CloudFormation makes the same API calls you make manually.

Stateless is better than stateful on the exam.

Immutable pattern:
Deployed application code can't modify existing cloud resources, which, as
a result, requires the creation of new resources.

Parameters allows you to pass values into the template.

If CloudFormation stack encounters an error, by default, your resources are terminated.

================================== Elastic Beanstalk ===============================
Favor Elastic Beanstalk if you see questions regarding simple solution to
bundle and deploy applications.

 - Deploys and scales your web applications, including the web application server platform.
 - Supported languages include Java, PHP, Python, Ruby, Go, .NETm Node.js.
 - PaaS that provisions the AWS resources for you (e.g. EC2, RDS, S3, Elastic
Load Balancer, Auto Scaling Groups)
 - OS and application server updates. Monitoring metrics, and health checks
 are all included
 - It can fully manage the EC2 instances for you, or you can take full
 administrative control

================================== Systems Manager ===============================
For sensitive data that needs to be stored and referenced in a secure manner.

Automation documents are the primary method used in scenarios asking you to
configure the inside of an EC2 instance.

 - Systems Manager can manage both on-premises and AWS compute.
 - Patch manager can patch, update and configure instances.
 - Automation Documents are usable by AWS Config to enforce architecture states.
 - Parameter Store is free to store config data and even secret values.
 - Securely connect to your compute using Session Manager instead of SHH or RDP.
 - Systems Manager interactions require the SMM Agent to be installed and running.
