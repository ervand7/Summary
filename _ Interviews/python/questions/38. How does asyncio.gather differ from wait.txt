asyncio.gather:
* Runs coroutines concurrently
* Returns results in order
* Fails fast on first exception (by default)

asyncio.wait:
* Waits for futures to complete
* Returns done and pending sets
* Gives more control over completion behavior

Rule of thumb:
> gather for results, wait for control



More detailed:
## `asyncio.gather` — *“give me all results”*

### Example

```python
import asyncio

async def job(n):
    await asyncio.sleep(n)
    return n

async def main():
    result = await asyncio.gather(job(1), job(2))
    print(result)

asyncio.run(main())
```

Output

```
[1, 2]
```

### What it does

* Starts coroutines concurrently
* Waits for all to finish
* Returns results in the same order
* If one fails → raises immediately (default)

👉 Use when you care about results

---

## `asyncio.wait` — *“tell me who finished”*

### Example

```python
import asyncio

async def job(n):
    await asyncio.sleep(n)
    return n

async def main():
    tasks = [
        asyncio.create_task(job(1)),
        asyncio.create_task(job(2)),
    ]

    done, pending = await asyncio.wait(tasks)
    print(len(done), len(pending))

asyncio.run(main())
```

Output

```
2 0
```

### What it does

* Waits for tasks to complete
* Returns two sets: `done`, `pending`
* No results automatically
* You decide what to do next

👉 Use when you need control

---

## Early return example (`wait` advantage)

```python
done, pending = await asyncio.wait(
    tasks,
    return_when=asyncio.FIRST_COMPLETED
)
```

* Returns when first task finishes
* Others stay pending

## Key difference (one glance)

| Feature              | `gather` | `wait` |
| -------------------- | -------- | ------ |
| Returns results      | ✅ Yes    | ❌ No   |
| Keeps order          | ✅ Yes    | ❌      |
| Fail-fast            | ✅ Yes    | ❌      |
| Partial completion   | ❌        | ✅      |
| Fine-grained control | ❌        | ✅      |

## One-line memory hook

> `gather` = collect results
> `wait` = manage task lifecycle

If you want, next I can show what happens on exceptions or how to cancel pending tasks safely.
