### Core difference (one sentence)

* SNS → *broadcast a message*
* SQS → *store a task until someone processes it*

---

### Think in real life

#### 📣 SNS = loudspeaker

> “Order created!”

* Everyone listening hears it
* Same message goes to many receivers
* No storage

#### 📦 SQS = mailbox

> “Process this order”

* Message waits until one worker picks it up
* If worker crashes → message comes back
* Reliable task execution

### Side-by-side (short)

|                | SNS                         | SQS                   | EventBridge               |
| -------------- | ----------------------------| ----------------------| --------------------------|
| Model          | Pub/Sub                     | Queue                 | Event bus (rules-based)   |
| Delivery       | Push                        | Pull                  | Push                      |
| Consumers      | Many (same message to all)  | One per message       | Many (matched by rules)   |
| Message stored | ❌ No                       | ✅ Yes                | ❌ No                     |
| Ordering       | ❌ No                       | ✅ (FIFO)             | ❌ No                     |
| Filtering      | ❌ No                       | ❌ No                 | ✅ Yes                    |
| Use case       | Broadcast notifications     | Background processing | Application event routing |

### Common AWS pattern (important 💡)

```
Producer
   |
   v
  SNS
   |
   v
  SQS
   |
   v
 Lambda workers
```

Why?

* SNS → fan-out
* SQS → reliability + retries
