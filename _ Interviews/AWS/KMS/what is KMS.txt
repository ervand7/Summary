AWS KMS (Key Management Service) is a managed service for creating, storing,
and using encryption keys.

Very short:

> It lets AWS services encrypt/decrypt data securely without you handling keys yourself.

Used for:

* Encrypting Lambda env vars
* Encrypting S3, RDS, EBS data
* Controlling access to encryption via IAM policies
