Passwords must never be stored in plain text.

Best practices:
* Hash passwords, don’t encrypt them
* Use strong password hash functions:
  - bcrypt
  - argon2 (preferred)
* Add a unique salt per password
* Use sufficient cost / work factor
* Compare hashes in constant time

Never do:
* Plain hashing (SHA256, MD5)
* Reversible encryption
* Storing passwords in logs or DB dumps

Key idea:
> Store only slow, salted password hashes
