A plugin system loads and executes external components dynamically.

Basic design:
* Define a clear interface (ABC / protocol)
* Plugins implement that interface
* Discover plugins via entry points, config, or directory scanning
* Load them dynamically (importlib)
* Register plugins in a registry

Key ideas:
* Loose coupling
* Stable interface
* Runtime extensibility

Summary:
> Plugin system = discover, load, validate, execute
