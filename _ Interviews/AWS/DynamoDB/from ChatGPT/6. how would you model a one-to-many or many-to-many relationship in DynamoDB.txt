Modeling relationships in DynamoDB

One-to-many:

* Use a single partition key for the “one”
* Use sort key to represent the “many”
* Example:
  PK = USER#123
  SK = ORDER#2024-01-01

* Query by PK to fetch all related items

Many-to-many:

* Use a single-table design
* Create linking items (join records)
* Example:
  PK = USER#123   SK = GROUP#456
  PK = GROUP#456  SK = USER#123

* Optionally add GSIs for reverse lookups

Key principles:

* Model by access patterns, not joins
* Duplicate data when needed
* Avoid cross-partition transactions

Interview one-liner:

> In DynamoDB, one-to-many is modeled with a shared partition key and sorted items,
while many-to-many uses explicit linking items and GSIs, designed around access
patterns instead of joins.
