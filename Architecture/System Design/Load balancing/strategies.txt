### 1. **Round Robin**
   - Requests are distributed sequentially to each server in a rotating order. This
   method is simple and works well when all servers have similar capacity.
   - **Use case**: Small to medium-sized applications with equally capable servers.

### 2. **Weighted Round Robin**
   - An extension of Round Robin where each server is assigned a weight based on its
   capacity or priority. Higher-weighted servers receive more requests.
   - **Use case**: Environments where servers have varying processing power or network
   capabilities.

### 3. **Least Connections**
   - Directs each request to the server with the fewest active connections at the time.
   It’s beneficial when requests have long durations or varying resource demands.
   - **Use case**: Applications with long-lived or heavy sessions.

### 4. **Weighted Least Connections**
   - A variation of Least Connections where weights are assigned to servers based on their
   capacity, prioritizing servers with fewer connections and higher weights.
   - **Use case**: Complex environments with servers of differing capacities and uneven
   workloads.

### 5. **IP Hashing**
   - Routes requests based on the client’s IP address. A hash function determines the
   server by creating a consistent mapping between IP addresses and servers, ensuring a
   client consistently connects to the same server.
   - **Use case**: When session persistence is required without storing session data
   centrally (e.g., in gaming or online banking).

### 6. **Least Response Time**
   - Sends requests to the server with the quickest response time. This approach takes
   into account the current server load and response speed, aiming to minimize latency.
   - **Use case**: Applications where low latency is essential, like real-time services
   or media streaming.

### 7. **Resource-Based Load Balancing**
   - Routes requests based on real-time server metrics, such as CPU and memory usage.
   The load balancer uses monitoring data to assess which server has the most available
   resources.
   - **Use case**: Highly dynamic environments where server loads vary frequently.

### 8. **Random Selection**
   - Requests are assigned to a server randomly, without any specific distribution logic. This strategy is generally only used in specific testing scenarios.
   - **Use case**: Testing or when servers are nearly identical and balanced randomly.

### 9. **Geographic or Proximity-Based Routing**
   - Routes requests to the server closest to the user’s geographic location, reducing
   latency and improving response times.
   - **Use case**: Globally distributed applications like content delivery networks (CDNs)
   and large-scale web applications.

### 10. **Fixed Weighted or Priority-Based Routing**
   - Prioritizes certain servers over others. Only if the higher-priority servers are full
   or unavailable are requests sent to lower-priority servers.
   - **Use case**: Redundancy and failover strategies where a subset of servers should be
   prioritized unless unavailable.

### 11. **Content-Based Routing**
   - Routes requests based on the content type or request parameters (e.g., directing image
   requests to servers optimized for media files).
   - **Use case**: Complex web applications where certain types of requests are better
   handled by specialized servers.

### **Choosing the Right Strategy**
The ideal load balancing strategy depends on:
   - **Server capacity**: Use weighted strategies if servers have different capabilities.
   - **Session persistence**: Use IP hashing if the same client must connect to the same server.
   - **Response time sensitivity**: Use least response time for applications that need low
   latency.
   - **Geographic spread**: Use proximity-based routing for globally distributed user bases.

Using multiple strategies together can further optimize traffic handling based on the
application’s unique requirements.
