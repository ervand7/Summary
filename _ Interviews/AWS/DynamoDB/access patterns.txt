In DynamoDB, access patterns = the exact queries your app must support.

Examples:

* Get user by user_id
* Get all orders of a user, sorted by time
* Get latest session for a user
* Get items by status + timestamp (via GSI)

You design keys first, data second.
If you can’t express a query with PK / SK (or GSI) → it’s the wrong pattern for DynamoDB.

👉 DynamoDB is *query-driven*, not schema-driven.
