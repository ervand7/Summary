1. Relative stability: ancored or pegged -> $1.00
    1. Chainlinc price feed
    2. Set a function to exchange ETH & BTC -> $$$
2. Stability mechanism (Minting): algotithmic (decentralized)
    1. People can only mint the stablecoin with enough collateral  (coded)
3. Collateral: exogenous (crypto)
    1. wETH
    2. wBTC


What are our invariants?
1) The total supply of DSC should be less than the total value of collateral
2) Getter view functions should never revert
