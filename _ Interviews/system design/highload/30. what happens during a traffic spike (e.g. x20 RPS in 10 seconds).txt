👉 A sudden spike causes instant overload before autoscaling or humans can react.

What happens first:
* Incoming requests increase sharply
* Latency starts growing immediately
* Number of in-flight requests explodes (`RPS × latency`)

Then internal limits are hit:
* DB / Redis connection pools saturate
* Goroutines block waiting on I/O
* Memory usage increases rapidly
* GC pressure grows

If there is no protection:
* Timeouts start firing
* Retries amplify traffic
* Load spreads to downstream services
* Cascading failures occur

With proper safeguards:
* Backpressure limits accepted work
* Excess traffic is rejected or queued
* System remains slow but alive
* Recovery is possible after the spike

Key insight:
* Spikes kill systems through accumulated waiting, not raw traffic volume
* Systems must be designed to shed load immediately

One-line interview answer:
> During a traffic spike, latency and concurrency grow rapidly, exhausting pools and
memory; without backpressure the system collapses, while proper load shedding keeps
it slow but stable.
