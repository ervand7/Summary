Each semantic comes with a benefit and cost.

Value semantic:
Value semantics keep values on the stack which reduces pressure on the GC.
However, there are different copies of any given value that must be stored,
tracked and maintained.

Pointer semantics:
Pointer semantics place values on the heap which can put pressure on the GC. However,
they are efficient because there is only one value that needs to be stored, tracked and
maintained. The key is using each semantic correctly, consistently and in balance.
